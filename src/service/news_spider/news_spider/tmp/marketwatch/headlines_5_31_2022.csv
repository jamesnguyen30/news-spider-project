0,Brace for another selloff if U.S. stocks reach this technical 'danger zone',,"“Top Gun: Maverick” is taking American cinemas by storm, so it’s only right that Wall Street strategists would work some references to the classic 1980s franchise into their client research which is often shared with the media.

And now that U.S. stocks have broken a historic string of weekly losses, market analysts are looking to technical indicators to determine where the “danger zone” for equities might lie.

The ‘danger zone’

According to Jonathan Krinsky, a market technician at BTIG, the new “danger zone” for U.S. stocks corresponds roughly with the 50-day moving average for the S&P 500 SPX, -0.07% , which is presently right around 4,275 although Krinsky believes equities would meet resistance slightly earlier at around 4,250, which is the top end of the “summer chop” range he anticipates.

Source: BTIG

Reaching the 50-day moving average would be quite a feat in itself, seeing it would represent a roughly 12% rally off the bear-market lows just above 3,800 from which the S&P 500 bounced earlier this month, while the Dow bottomed out just north of 30,600 DJIA, -0.15% .

A counter-cyclical rally

Interestingly, Krinsky pointed to a overstretched positioning in the best-performing sectors for stocks (i.e. energy), claiming that “the strategy of buying winners and selling losers is coming off the most extreme level in over 13 years.” Because of this, Krinsky expects a swift bout of counter-cyclical reversion – where technology stocks lead markets higher, a dynamic that has already been witnessed during the past week – to be the near-term catalyst for a rebound in stocks.

He pointed to trading action during the summer of 2008, where the S&P 500 saw a double-digit rally (in percentage point terms) before ultimately collapsing later in the year. That rally was also characterized by counter-cyclical moves, as long-short momentum funds endured heavy losses.

In such a “reversion” scenario, Krinsky believes the Nasdaq 100 – represented in Krinsky’s note by the Invesco QQQ ETF QQQ, +0.28% – could outperform.

What about the ‘VIX’?

Following the period of summer chop, Krinsky believes U.S. stocks will eventually move lower to plumb new depths as the fall approaches. This brings us to the CBOE Volatility Index – otherwise known as the ‘VIX’ VIX, +2.72% .

According to Krinsky, clients have asked many times why the VIX hasn’t been able to hold above 35 despite a nearly 20% selloff in the S&P 500 from peak to trough.

Krinsky argues that a move to 40 or above on the VIX could still arrive – but it might not come until later in the summer, or the fall.

“In 2000 and 2008, it took nearly a year of a weak market, and then some sort of ‘event shock’ like 9/11 or Lehman to get a surge above 40,” Krinsky said.",['Joseph Adinolfi'],MarketWatch,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/brace-for-another-selloff-if-u-s-stocks-reach-this-technical-danger-zone-11654001519?mod=newsviewer_click,https://images.mktw.net/im-554330/social
1,Big talk and big money: Texas con duped dozens into believing they were investing in events like a Rihanna tour and the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight,,"The swindle always began with a flashy show of wealth and the mention of a well-known celebrity who was an investor. And it always ended with a victim losing their life savings.

Along the way, Sean T. Johnson, 42, of Dallas, tailored his con based on the gender, age and lifestyle of his mark, prosecutors said.

He would claim to be involved in financing major events, like a party in Washington for the second inauguration of President Barack Obama, a world tour by the singer Rihanna and even the much-hyped 2015 fight between boxing champs Floyd Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao.

If Johnson’s target was able to invest even a few thousand dollars, he promised they could get rich too. To make it look legit, prosecutors said Johnson would have his “assistant” send over a written promissory note, boasting that they would make back as much as 40% on their investment in a few months.

But according to federal authorities, there was no assistant and Johnson wasn’t involved in staging any events — the money went right into his pockets.

Last week, he was sentenced to a decade behind bars for ripping off over a dozen victims to the tune of $1 million. Some victims lost tens of thousands of dollars and others several hundred thousand.

“For over ten years, the defendant made his living swindling people out of money – lots of people and lots of money,” prosecutors wrote in court papers arguing for the stiffest sentence possible. “He was a professional con-man who used his good-natured and seemingly relaxed personality to endear himself to unsuspecting people and gained their confidence through a mix of friendly banter and schoolyard braggadocio.”

Johnson’s lawyer didn’t return a call seeking comment. His client has been behind bars since he was arrested in 2018. He pleaded guilty in 2019.

Prosecutors say Johnson targeted people from all walks of life, including a sophisticated real estate investor in Miami, a Washington D.C. limo company owner and a London fashion model and her family.

Johnson presented himself as an extremely wealthy businessman, often wearing high-end suits, arriving places in a chauffeur-driven black Rolls Royce and plunking down for expensive bottle service at the most exclusive nightclubs, according to court filings.

He’d claim he was friends with celebrities like rapper Jay-Z. He’d show victims photos of him with Floyd Mayweather and say they were in business together. He claimed financier Carl Icahn had been his mentor and taught him everything he knew. Johnson would talk about his 12-bedroom mansion outside of Atlanta or his penthouse apartment in New York.

None of it was true, prosecutors said, and all the trappings of wealth Johnson showed had been paid for with money he had stolen from others.

“Once the defendant won over his victim, he typically moved in on their weakness – a young man with a little extra cash who wanted to turn it into a nest egg; a successful man who didn’t have time to turn his well-earned money into a larger pile of cash; or, more sadly, a woman who sought romance and companionship, but was taken instead for all her savings,” prosecutors said.

In one case, he invited an El Paso, Texas real estate agent to sit courtside at a San Antonio Spurs playoff game, but had her front the money for the tickets and then never paid her back, court filings said. He had convinced her to invest thousands more in an event around the NCAA tournament that turned out to be a charade.

Prosecutors say many of Johnson’s victims lost their life savings, had their credit ruined or were forced into foreclosure or bankruptcy as a result of his schemes.",['Lukas I.

3,Clinton campaign lawyer Sussmann acquitted in setback to Durham probe of origins of Trump-Russia investigation,,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A lawyer for Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign was acquitted Tuesday of lying to the FBI when he pushed information meant to cast suspicions on Donald Trump and Russia in the run-up to the 2016 election.

The case against Michael Sussmann was the first courtroom test of special counsel John Durham since his appointment three years ago to search for government misconduct during the investigation into potential ties between Russia and Trump’s 2016 campaign. The verdict represents a setback for Durham’s work, especially since Trump supporters had looked to the probe to expose what they contend was egregious bias by law enforcement officials who investigated the former president.

The jury deliberated on Friday afternoon and Tuesday morning before reaching its verdict.

“While we are disappointed in the outcome, we respect the jury’s decision and thank them for their service. I also want to recognize and thank the investigators and the prosecution team for their dedicated efforts in seeking truth and justice in this case,” Durham said in a statement.

The trial focused on whether Sussmann, a cybersecurity attorney and former federal prosecutor, concealed from the FBI that he was representing Clinton’s campaign when he presented computer data that he said showed a possible secret backchannel between Russia-based Alfa Bank and Trump’s business company, the Trump Organization. The FBI investigated but quickly determined that there was no suspicious contact.

The bureau’s then–general counsel and the government’s star witness, James Baker, testified that he was “100% confident” that Sussmann had told him that he was not representing any client during the meeting. Prosecutors say he was actually acting on behalf of the Clinton campaign and another client, and that he hid that information so as to make it seem more credible and to boost the chances of persuading the FBI to investigate.

Lawyers for Sussmann deny that he lied, saying that it was impossible to know with certainty what he told Baker since they were the only participants in the meeting and neither of them took notes.

They argued that if Sussmann said he wasn’t acting on the Clinton campaign’s behalf that that was technically accurate since he didn’t ask the FBI to take any particular action. And they said that even if he did make a false statement, it was ultimately irrelevant since the FBI was already investigating Russia and the Trump campaign and would have looked into the Alfa Bank data no matter the source.

During the two-week trial, jurors heard from current and former FBI officials who described efforts to assess the data’s legitimacy as well as former Clinton campaign aides.

The original Trump-Russia investigation, overseen for two years by former special counsel Robert Mueller, found multiple efforts by Russia to interfere on the Trump campaign’s behalf but did not establish that the two sides had worked together to sway the election.

After Mueller’s work was done, then–Attorney General William Barr named a new Justice Department prosecutor, then–Connecticut U.S. Attorney Durham, to examine whether anyone from the FBI or other agencies violated the law as the government opened its investigation into Russian election interference and the Trump campaign.

Durham has remained at work during the Biden administration under the DOJ leadership of Merrick Garland. He has brought three cases so far, though the one against Sussmann is the only to have reached trial.

A former FBI lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, was given probation after pleading guilty in 2020 to altering an email related to the surveillance of an ex-Trump campaign aide, and a Russian analyst who contributed to a dossier of Democratic-funded research into ties between Russia and Trump awaits trial on charges of lying to the FBI about his information sources.",['Associated Press'],MarketWatch,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/clinton-campaign-lawyer-sussmann-acquitted-in-setback-to-durham-probe-of-origins-of-trump-russia-investigation-01654013690?mod=newsviewer_click,https://images.mktw.net/im-554564/social
4,"Excitement in Shanghai as officials promise reopening after two-month lockdown, and cases continue to flatten in U.S. Northeast",,"There was excitement in Shanghai Tuesday after officials said they would take some major steps Wednesday toward reopening and ending the two-month COVID-19 lockdown in China’s largest city that has kept most residents confined to their homes.

Full bus and subway service will be restored as will basic rail connections with the rest of China, Vice Mayor Zong Ming said Tuesday at a daily municipal news conference on the outbreak, the Associated Press reported.

Schools will partially reopen on a voluntary basis for students, and shopping malls, supermarkets, drugstores and convenience stores will continue to reopen gradually at no more than 75% of capacity. Cinemas and gyms will remain closed.

Shanghai counted just 29 new COVID cases on Monday, well below the roughly 20,000 a day it was recording in April. Li Qiang, the top official from China’s ruling Communist Party in Shanghai, was quoted as saying at a meeting Monday that the city had made major achievements in fighting the outbreak through continuous struggle.

Despite censorship, videos shared online show growing desperation and anger at prolonged Covid-19 lockdowns in China’s economic capital of Shanghai, where officials are trying to solve issues including food shortages while doubling down on the country’s strict pandemic policy.

The news was welcomed by investors, who sent oil prices surging 3.7% on expectations that the reopening would help restart the local economy. Shanghai is a major manufacturing hub.

In the U.S., cases may be stabilizing after climbing steadily since the end of March thanks to the highly infectious omicron variant and its subvariants.

The U.S. is averaging 109,105 cases a day, up 14% from two weeks ago, according to a New York Times tracker. But cases are flattening in states in the Northeast that were recent hot spots, including New York, New Jersey and Rhode Island. They are rising, however, in the South and Southwest and have more than doubled in Arizona, South Carolina and West Virgina over the last two weeks.

The country is averaging 26,781 hospitalizations a day, up 20% from two weeks ago but far below the January omicron peak of more than 150,000. The daily death toll stands at 368 on average, up 22% from two weeks ago.

Other COVID-19 news you should know about:

• Nasal vaccines as protection against COVID-19 are being studied in seven clinical trials, according to Mayuresh Abhyankar, a University of Virginia researcher, who explains that vaccinating someone right where the coronavirus is likely to start its attack comes with many immunological benefits. Intranasal vaccines are best suited to protect against pathogens that enter through the nose, like the flu or the coronavirus causing COVID-19. By mimicking the first step of natural exposure to an airborne pathogen, these vaccines help train a person’s immune system at the potential place of infection.

• The World Health Organization’s governing board agreed on Monday to form a new committee to help speed up its response to health emergencies like COVID-19, as Reuters reported. The agency has faced criticism for its handling of the pandemic, including delays early in the crisis. Some disease experts say that governments and the WHO must avoid repeating such early missteps with other outbreaks like monkeypox. The resolution, passed unanimously at the 34-member executive board’s annual meeting, will form a new Standing Committee on Health Emergency Prevention, Preparedness and Response to help address perceived shortcomings.

• U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has come under fire again after leaked text messages reported over the weekend suggested that he and his wife met two friends at their flat on June 19, 2020, for the prime minister’s birthday, when indoor socializing was banned, the Guardian reported. The social event was not considered by the recent inquiry into breaches of COVID rules by Johnson and his fellow Tories, a scandal nicknamed “partygate,” which has led to calls for Johnson to resign.

• A Beijing man has landed thousands of his neighbors in quarantine after he ignored an order to stay at home and later tested positive for COVID-19, prompting a police investigation, CBS News reported. The man in his 40s with the surname Sun failed to follow a requirement to isolate that he was given after visiting a shopping mall deemed to be high risk. Sun and his wife later tested positive, prompting authorities to lock down 5,000 of their neighbors at home and send 250 to a government quarantine center.

5,What GM’s idea for an EV with two charging ports says about the car market,,"You could fill a pot a lot faster with two faucets, you know.

That may not sound like a great engineering insight that revolutionizes transportation in America. But it might be the start of something.

General Motors GM, +0.39% has filed a patent application with an incredibly simple idea, but one that is illustrative of the way cars are changing.

It’s an EV with two plugs.

Lasers, conveyor belts, and tear gas: car companies and their patents

First, a quick note on patents: Automakers are some of the most aggressive users of America’s patent system. They routinely file for patents they may never use.

Tesla, TSLA, +0.57% not kidding you here, holds a patent for a laser windshield cleaning system. Toyota TM, -0.16% holds a patent for an in-car fragrance system that can also dispense tear gas for self-defense. Ford F, +0.66% holds a patent for a conveyor belt that brings items from the trunk to the front seat.

Even companies that only think about building cars hold patents for them. Google GOOGL, +2.24% holds a patent for a hood sticky enough to immobilize a human being. It’s meant as a safety device – if you hit a pedestrian with your car, they’d stick to the hood instead of bouncing off and getting a second set of injuries from hitting the road. But imagine washing it after a drive through Louisiana in bug season.

An idea doesn’t have to be good to earn a patent. It just has to be novel. And car makers routinely patent ideas they never execute.

Check out: Here are the 10 fastest EVs (and how much they cost)

GM’s batteries are already two batteries

GM’s new generation of electric cars, like the GMC Hummer and Cadillac Lyriq, is built on a platform the automaker calls Ultium. Ultium is a single, skateboard-like unit of batteries, motors, and suspension that fits beneath a car’s cabin.

Engineers can scale it up or down to build vehicles as large as the Chevy Silverado EV and as small as (probably even smaller than) the Chevy Blazer EV. The design will underlay an entire generation of GM vehicles. It’s successful enough that even Honda plans to use it for its first dedicated EV, the upcoming Honda HMC, -1.02% Prologue.

The way GM scales the battery up for larger vehicles is, essentially, to wire two of them together. The Hummer and Silverado both use a two-layer battery. So why not charge them separately?

EV voltage

Some electric vehicles, such as Tesla products, use a 400-volt architecture. Some, like the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6, use an 800-volt setup. Electrical charging is complicated and not as simple as 800-volt batteries charging twice as fast as 400-volt batteries. But the 800-volt systems currently on the market do charge faster than 400-volt EVs.

What would be even faster? Using both.

GM’s patent would let users charge the entire battery from one 800-volt port, the entire battery from one 400-volt port, or half of it from one of each. The ports are bidirectional, so they could also be used to power other EVs or equipment in the field.

As demand for electric vehicles grows, mining for minerals needed to make them may produce additional ESG challenges. Here's what investors should know.

Electrical engineers are the new garage tinkerers

The patent may never become a working system. Many automaker patents never do. This could be just another drawing of a sticky hood.

But it illustrates something new about the car market.

Engineers learned to tease as much performance as possible from the internal combustion engine through a century of tinkering and trying wacky things with fire.

A pair of charging cords (and a driver using two charging stations at once while cars line up for their turn) may not be the innovation that makes EVs easier for Americans to live with day-to-day. But electrical engineers are the new creative thinkers who will reshape what our cars cost and do for us.

6,"Why Is the Stock Market Down Today? Dow Slips, Oil Prices Rise, Alibaba Jumps.",,"The stock market was mostly down Tuesday, as oil prices gained after Europe placed more restrictions on Russian oil.

In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average retreated 125 points, or 0.4%, while the S&P 500 declined 0.3%. The Nasdaq Composite was down 0.1%.

While technology stocks were holding the line, the majority of stocks were feeling some pain. The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Exchange-Traded Fund (ticker: RSP), which weights each stock in the index equally and therefore shows the move of the average stock, was down 0.7%.

The price of oil jumped to more than $119 a barrel, a level it hadn’t seen since early March, when it became clear that Russia was launching a full invasion of Ukraine. The move comes after the European Union said it would impose an oil embargo on Russia, which would include the vast majority of Russian oil imports by the end of the year. Pipeline exports of oil, specifically, will continue.

Higher oil prices could mean trouble for the stock market. If the price of oil stays elevated, it could bring inflation up slightly. High inflation has already been a problem, as companies have seen higher costs and falling profit margins, forcing them to lift prices, a threat to consumer demand. The latest inflation result in the U.S. showed that the rate of price increases is declining, and higher oil could get in the way of the progress.

“Spiking energy prices [are] putting a cloud over peak inflation hopes,” wrote Louis Navellier, founder of Navellier & Associates.

The other issue is that the Federal Reserve is trying to combat inflation by lifting short-term interest rates, a move that is likely to dent economic growth. The Fed implied recently that it could slow down the pace of rate hikes as the economy slows, so markets do not want to see evidence that the pace of rate hikes will be on the faster side.

The Fed’s job becomes particularly difficult if oil prices are high enough to disrupt consumer spending. Higher inflation traditionally makes the Fed more likely to lift rates, which hurts demand. But if higher oil is already hurting demand and, on top of that, the Fed lifts rates rather quickly, many will fear that recession is imminent.

“The surge in oil prices can put the economy into recession,” said Ed Yardeni, founder of Yardeni Research. “Do they [the Fed] want to make it worse?”

As if to reinforce this point, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said he was willing to raise rates above the so-called neutral rate if it meant getting inflation heading back toward 2%. “Waller took back the punchbowl from the one week reprieve equity and bond markets had last week,” wrote NatAlliance Securities’ Andrew Brenner.

What’s more, concerns about inflation, the Fed, oil prices, and the like—what are known as macroeconomic factors—are likely to have a bigger impact on day-to-day stock market moves now that earnings season is over. That’s because investors will be left to guess how these factors will impact corporate profits for the next couple of months, rather than having companies tell them how these forces are impacting them.

“Macroeconomic cross currents remain high, and uncertainty about the path of inflation, policy, and growth is elevated,” wrote Dennis DeBusschere, founder of 22VResearch. “For now, that means …market volatility tied to major macro releases and Fed meetings.”

The good news is that the broader market’s pain this year does seems to be subsiding, overall. To be sure, the market is down Tuesday, but the decline doesn’t look worrisome. The S&P 500 is still well above its intraday low for the year, which it hit May 20. More buyers seem to be coming back into the market. “Strong market internals generated several ‘breadth thrust’ signals that should have us open minded that stocks are building bases,” wrote John Kolovos, chief technical strategist at Macro Risk Advisors.

One of those strong signals: the majority of S&P 500 stocks have just begun to rise back to key levels. Abut 86% of stocks on the index are above their 20-day moving averages, according to Instinet. That means that most stocks are trading at higher price levels, as the market becomes slightly more confident in future gains.

But one thing is clear for now: the stock market isn’t out of the woods yet. The indexes are still down double digits in percentage terms for the year an are still sensitive to ominous macro developments.

Outside the U.S., China began lifting some Covid restrictions, helping the Shanghai Composite gain 1.2%, while Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 ended 0.3% lower. The pan-European Stoxx 600 fell 0.7%.

Here are five stocks on the move Tuesday:

The easing of China’s Covid-19 restrictions has seen a rally in Chinese stocks—including a number of U.S.-listed Chinese tech companies. Alibaba (ticker: BABA) jumped 2.7%, with e-commerce peer JD.com (JD) 5.9% higher. Electric-vehicle maker NIO (NIO) rallied 5%.

Unilever (UL) surged 9.3%, after the consumer-products company said it appointed billionaire investor Nelson Peltz as a nonexecutive director and confirmed his Trian Fund Management holds a roughly 1.5% stake in the group.

Zoom Video Communications (ZM) stock slipped 2.2% even after getting upgraded to Outperform from Underperform at Daiwa Securities.

8,Small-caps Are Beaten Down. They Could Rise the Fastest.,,"Small market capitalization stocks have gotten hit the hardest this year. Now, they could rise the fastest as a sense of relief about the economy sets in for the moment.

The Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks has dropped 17% this year, worse than the large cap S&P 500’s 14% fall. One of the overarching concerns is about slowing economic growth, which has already begun.

The root cause is high inflation, which is starting to eat at consumer demand and lower company profit margins as costs rise.

The Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes, designed to reduce inflation, are only worsening fears about spending in the economy. Small cap companies’ earnings are more sensitive to concerns around sales and margins because they cannot reduce costs to the same degree that larger companies can.

At this point, confidence in the economy looks like it can only get better.

First off, the Fed implied on its most recent minutes that it could slow down the pace of rate hikes as the economy slows. Supporting that hope is that the rate of inflation looks to be declining.

That is all combined with the fact that small business optimism can’t get much worse from here. The Small Business Optimism Index recently hit a reading of just below five, for its lowest level since the 2020 Covid-19 recession, according to Evercore data.

With confidence in the economy potentially on the mend, small-cap stocks look set to outperform. When the index hits five or lower, the historical average move for the Russell 2000 a year from that point is a 28% gain. That beats the S&P 500’s average return from that point by about 10 percentage points.

The superior small cap performance may have already begun, as the Russell 2000 has beaten the S&P 500 by almost 2 percentage points from its intraday low of the year hit in May.

A continuation of the rally in small stocks could happen in short order—and without much interruption. That is partly because short interest in the group is high. That means many market participants have bet against these stocks, so if they keep rising, those “shot sellers” will have to buy shares back before their losses mount.

Just over 120 million shares of the iShares Russell 2000 Exchange-Traded Fund (IWM) are shorted currently, which is just above 40% of the total shares outstanding. It’s also near the highest number of shorted shares in the ETF since early 2021.

That could help in the short-run.

But generally, the positive small cap outlook makes sense because these stocks have been trading particularly cheaply. The aggregate forward price/earnings ratio on the Russell 2000 is a touch below the S&P 500’s 17.4 times. History says that is too low, as the Russell 2000 has consistently traded at a multiple about 5 points above the S&P 500’s since at least 2014, according to Evercore.

This indicates that the prices of small-cap stocks aren’t necessarily reflecting the full earnings stream that investors could expect—so long as optimism in the economic outlook keeps improving.

For now, reaping strong returns in small-caps requires optimism that the economy isn’t headed into free fall.

9,"When will you pay $5 gas? After EU agrees to ban most Russian oil imports, it may be sooner than you think",,"Nearly 35 million people were estimated to hit the roads this Memorial Day Weekend, providing another reminder about soaring gas prices and the impact that will have on drivers’ budgets.

That gas-pump pinch could only get tighter in America, now that European Union leaders have agreed to a ban that will wean Europe off 90% of Russian oil by the end of the year, say gas price experts.

“Agreement to ban export of Russian oil to the EU. This immediately covers more than 2/3 of oil imports from Russia, cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine,” EU Council president Charles Michel wrote in a tweet late Monday.

“This sanctions package includes other hard-hitting measures: de-Swifting the largest Russian bank Sberbank, banning 3 more Russian state-owned broadcasters, and sanctioning individuals responsible for war crimes in Ukraine,” he added.

“The EU ban contributes to the trend of higher prices,” said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, a Houston, Texas-based energy industry consulting firm. “I fully expect over the next 10 days, gas prices will rise to $4.75 a gallon. $5 a gallon becomes an ever-increasing possibility.”

The near-complete oil import ban announced Monday is another coordinated economic sanction against Russia for its Ukrainian invasion now grinding past three months. The EU agreement will halt 90% of Russian oil imports to the EU by the end of 2022.

On Tuesday, AAA said the national average price for a gallon of gas was $4.62, another record-breaking price. The average prices in roughly 20 states exceed that price, AAA data shows.

The $5 mark can be a psychological price point when drivers start following through on gas-conserving steps, like carpools, clustered chores and generally driving less, past surveys have said.

So when is $5 national average gas arriving? It could be a matter of weeks, Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said Monday on Twitter. The EU ban announcement heightened the chance of $5 gas, De Haan said.

Last week, J.P. Morgan JPM, +0.57% analysts predicted national averages of $6 per gallon by the end of August. California drivers are already paying $6.16 a gallon on Tuesday, AAA data shows.

“As refineries scramble for alternative supplies, prices are going to rise,” Lipow said, noting that means refineries in America and Europe.

The question remains: How long can the American consumer withstand rising prices before scaling back demand?

Some aggregated traffic data suggest that there has not been a let up in demand and anecdotally, the high costs aren’t seriously phasing some summer plans. Yet some government data suggest cracks are appearing in consumer demand.

Lipow pointed four-week averages from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. At the end of April, the market saw 8.79 million barrels of finished gasoline supplied for drivers. That’s down from 8.94 million barrels of finished gasoline supplied a year ago at the same time.

The same dynamic applied for the four-week averages as of late May, when 8.84 million barrels of gas were supplied for drivers, compared to a year earlier when it was 9.09 million, the data showed.

“Weekly estimates indicate that gasoline demand from March through May 20, 2022, averaged about 6% less than 2019 levels, up significantly from April 2020 when it fell to 38% below 2019 levels,” the federal agency wrote last week.

“I think the demand destruction will only get worse as more stat reach the $5 threshold,” Lipow said.

Strained consumer finances are a serious matter, but the cost increases are linked with Russia’s violent invasion of Ukraine — a conflict that’s caused at least 6.8 million Ukrainians to flee the country, according to United Nations data. The UN says approximately 8 million people have been displaced within the country too.

President Joe Biden has previously called the gas price surge “Putin’s Price Hike” and he kept the finger pointed at Russian President Vladimir Putin in a Wall Street Journal op-ed published on Monday about his plans to fight inflation. He’s already announced his plans to release 180 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through early fall.

“The price at the pump is elevated in large part because Russian oil, gas and refining capacity are off the market,” Biden wrote Monday. “We can’t let up on our global effort to punish Mr. Putin for what he’s done, and we must mitigate these effects for American consumers.”",['Andrew Keshner'],MarketWatch,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/when-will-you-pay-5-gas-after-eu-agrees-to-ban-most-russian-oil-imports-it-may-be-sooner-than-you-think-11654018112?mod=newsviewer_click,https://images.mktw.net/im-554609/social
10,"Dish’s 5G Network Makes the Company a Buy, Says One Analyst",,"A broader rollout of Dish Network’s 5G network should produce solid results, says one Truist Securities analyst.

Greg Miller updated his rating on Dish (ticker: DISH) to Buy from Hold, citing Project Genesis, the pay-television provider’s new cellular network, as a factor that could move the stock higher in the coming months. Miller also raised his price target to $60 from $25.

Shares of Dish were 3.1% higher on Tuesday to $22.99. The stock has fallen 29% this year.

Project Genesis, Dish’s 5G cellular network, is currently only available in Las Vegas for consumers with Motorola phones, but Dish advertises that the network will be available in more than 120 cities this year.

“With one Project Genesis phone in the market currently (Motorola) with more to come with the launch of ~100 markets in the US before the end of June, we expect steady consumer share gain momentum to be combined with occasional enterprise gains in 2H22 to begin driving the stock higher again,” Miller said in a research note.

Miller also noted that presentations at a recent investor day made it clear that the cost of building a network, “comparable to that Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile, ” will be far more than the $10 billion investors had expected, a factor that has contributed to losses in the stock.

“Once investors are furnished with the real recurring operating costs of running the average cell site we can completely put potential existing investor disappointment behind and focus on the company’s ability to take market share at a likely lower than average industry margin profile, just as Leap Wireless and Metro PCS did years ago,” Miller wrote.

13,"5 Best Stocks in the S&P 500: Albemarle, NRG Energy, and 3 Oil Stocks",,"May was a rocky month for the stock market, but investors were still able to find some winners amid the carnage—especially in the energy sector.

The S&P 500 is down 0.6% this month. That might be somewhat surprising, given that the index dipped dangerously close to bear territory in May, fueling fears that it was approaching a drawn-out bear market.

While many stocks took a hit in May as investors fretted over challenging macroeconomic conditions, some were able to leverage a tough situation.

The energy sector, for example, has significantly outperformed the market, with the S&P 500 Energy Sector index providing a month-to-date return of 16.8%. This was likely driven by surging oil and gas prices, which have remained elevated since February, when Russia invaded Ukraine.

It’s no surprise, then, that energy stocks have led the S&P 500’s top performers in May. Here’s how the index’s winners have fared to date.

Albemarle

Specialty chemicals and materials manufacturer Albemarle (ticker: ALB) is the top performer in May, gaining 32.7% as of early market trading on Tuesday. Albemarle mines lithium and other chemicals that are crucial components for electric-vehicle batteries, and as demand for EVs skyrockets, so has Albemarle’s stock. The company recently raised its financial forecasts for the full year, even as others across sectors have lowered their estimates. The forecast update comes only three weeks since management issued previous guidance.

The stock has gained 11.6% this year.

2. Devon Energy

Tailing closely behind Albemarle is Devon Energy (DVN), which is up 32.5%. The company engages in oil and gas exploration—a sector that has benefited from rising oil prices. The shares have gained about 76% this year.

3. Occidental Petroleum

Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which also specializes in oil and gas exploration and production, has been a strong performer throughout the year. The stock has gained 151% in 2022, and 30.4% this month alone.

Earlier this month, the company reported record quarterly profit of $4.7 billion, even as production fell back.

4. Marathon Oil

Marathon Oil (MRO) is wrapping up a months-long sprint. Shares of the oil producer have risen about 29% in May and 97% this year. In April, Barron’s identified Maraton Oil as an energy stock that has generally traded with particularly low valuations.

5. NRG Energy

Utility company NRG Energy (NRG) has been a more quiet, yet stable, performer this month. The stock surged 28.3% in May, as investors have been steadily flocking to utility stocks as a way to hedge rising inflation. The shares are up 8.3% this year.

15,US summer fuel shortages could be worse than 1970s oil crisis: IEA chief,,"The United States and Europe could experience fuel shortages this summer that could be worse than the 1970s oil crisis as demand ramps up for travel season, the head of the International Energy Agency warned.

“When the main holiday season starts in Europe and the US, fuel demand will rise,” Fatih Birol told Der Spiegel.

“Then we could see shortages — for example, in diesel, petrol or kerosene, particularly in Europe.”

Birol said the current energy crisis could be worse and longer-lasting than the shocks of the 1970s.

“Back then it was just about oil,” he said. “Now we have an oil crisis, a gas crisis and an electricity crisis simultaneously.”

Oil prices spiked sharply as a result of the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War in 1973 as well as the Islamic Revolution in Iran in 1979.

This year, energy prices have been pushed upward after the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which has further disrupted already limited supply.

Gasoline prices have soared nationwide in the U.S, hitting record highs over the Memorial Day weekend.

American motorists are paying a nationwide average of $4.62 per gallon, according to AAA.

Motorists in California were feeling the strongest pinch, with some gas stations in parts of Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area and the Yosemite region charging in excess of $7.25 per gallon — more than the federal minimum wage.

On average, gas in the Golden State costs $6.15 a gallon, more than in any other in the nation, according to AAA. Californians are saddled with higher prices due to taxes and surcharges that are added onto the baseline cost of fuel.

In Los Angeles County, the most populous county in the country, gas prices reached a record $6.16 per gallon over Memorial Day holiday weekend — up almost $2 from the previous holiday record of $4.29 in 2012, CBS News Los Angeles reported.

The nationwide average, meanwhile, represents a 40% increase from the start of the year. It is also well above last year’s level of $3.04 per gallon.

Analysts predict that more states will cross the $5-per-gallon average by the Fourth of July holiday as demand is expected to increase while supply remains tight.

Global oil prices also continue to tick upwards. Brent crude, the international benchmark, surpassed $123 per barrel on Tuesday, reaching a two-month high.

West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, reached more than $118 a barrel on Monday.

16,"Gazprom Cuts Gas Deliveries to Oersted, Shell",,"By Jaime Llinares Taboada

Gazprom PJSC said Tuesday that it will cut gas supplies to Denmark's Oersted AS and Shell PLC after they refused to make payments in Russian roubles.

Russia's state-owned gas giant said that deliveries will be suspended from June 1 until payments are made in roubles.

Gazprom said that the contract with Shell was for a maximum of 1.2 billion cubic meters per year.

""Shell has not agreed to new payment terms set out by Gazprom, including the creation of K accounts. We will work to continue supplying our customers in Europe through our diverse portfolio of gas supply,"" a spokesperson for Shell said. Shell didn't disclose what countries ultimately receive those volumes.

Oersted said in a separate statement that it is under no obligation to pay in roubles and that it will continue to pay in euros.

Mads Nipper, the chief executive of the Danish company, said that Oersted had been preparing for this scenario and expects to be able to continue supplying gas to its customers.

On Monday, Gazprom announced that it would cut deliveries to Dutch trader GasTerra as it also refused to make payments in roubles.

In 2021 the EU imported 155 billion cubic meters of gas from Russia, around 40% of its total gas consumption, according to the International Energy Agency.

17,The next phase of America's competitive housing market: Renters facing bidding wars,,"Renters diving into a white-hot housing market are over-bidding on available apartments, marking the death knell of pandemic-era deals and months of free rent — all while potentially imperiling tenants who can’t afford to compete.

A realtor in Philadelphia, for example, told the Philadelphia Inquirer she “broke down and cried with my client” after losing a potential rental property to someone who was willing to pay $500 above the listed rental price. A renter in Los Angeles told the Los Angeles Daily News she forked over $60,000 — a year’s worth of rent, up front — just to land a five-bedroom home for her family after she was beat on offers for two separate places. A New York City tenant similarly told the New York Times they were outbid on “multiple rentals” before they were eventually able to secure an apartment.

The bidding trend seeping into the cut-throat race to sign a lease in some of America’s biggest cities comes amid a housing shortage and fast-rising rents. While some renters can — and will — pay above a landlord’s asking price to secure their spot in the frenzy, it’s just as likely that others will be priced out or wind up spending more than they should.

“Renters are being left with few options but to meet higher rents and, in some cases, even offer above asking — whether they can afford to or not,” Realtor.com Chief Economist Danielle Hale said in a statement this month after the real estate website released data showing the median rent in the nation’s 50 largest metropolitan areas had reached $1,827 in April.

“‘The current combination of high home prices and low inventories is making homeownership less accessible, pushing up rentership rates among older and higher-income households.’” — The Joint Center for Housing Studies

Higher-income tenants are increasingly entering the rental market, in part due to the rising cost of for-sale homes, according to the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies. That mean’s they competing with people who traditionally rent out of necessity, since they can’t afford homeownership.

“The current combination of high home prices and low inventories is making homeownership less accessible, pushing up rentership rates among older and higher-income households,” the Joint Center for Housing Studies said in a January report.

“At the same time, the influx of higher-income households into the rental market is driving up rents, potentially reducing the ability of younger and lower-income adults to form renter households,” it added. “The question now is whether there will be a sufficient supply of affordable and available housing to prevent this outcome.”

The nation is short 7 million affordable homes for extremely low-income renters, who are disproportionately Black, Latino, Native American, and Asian, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition. The organization attributed this shortage to a combination of systemic racism and income inequality.

Because rents are spiking — up 17% year-over-year in March, according to Redfin — one solution to avoiding bidding wars might be to simply stay put. Landlords may be more forgiving with existing tenants, Daryl Fairweather, Redfin’s chief economist, told MarketWatch.","['Emma Ockerman', 'The Joint Center For Housing Studies']",MarketWatch,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-next-phase-of-americas-competitive-housing-market-renters-facing-bidding-wars-11654016733?mod=newsviewer_click,https://images.mktw.net/im-457333/social

19,The EU Is Banning Russian Oil. What to Expect Now.,,"European leaders agreed to a partial ban on Russian oil imports, breaking a weekslong impasse that had halted stronger measures against the Kremlin in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine.

The ban, which is likely to lift global oil prices for weeks to come, covers Russian oil brought in by sea to all 27 member states, which European Union leaders say covers more than two-thirds of the bloc’s imports of crude from Russia. By the end of the year, the European Council hopes to ban 90% of Russian imports, according to Charles Michel, European Council president.

“We want to stop Russia’s war machine and cut the financing of Russia’s military capacity,” Michel said at a news conference.

This is the sixth package of sanctions against Russia announced by the European Council since the country invaded Ukraine in late February. The EU had previously banned coal imports from Russia, and had made pledges to phase out its dependence on Russian oil as it sought to join the U.S. in pressing Russia to end the war.

read more Oil Prices Surge

Here are the main points to know about the ban and what it could mean for the economy.

What’s included in the oil ban?

The ban covers crude oil and petroleum products delivered by sea from Russia into Europe’s 27 member states. The move was proposed on May 4, but ran into trouble as some countries sought a longer transition period.

The ban announced this week includes a temporary exemption for imports via pipeline, a crucial concession made to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, who had refused to sign on. Hungary receives around 60% of its crude and refined products from Russia.

The EU hasn’t moved to ban or restrict natural-gas imports from Russia.

How much oil does the EU import from Russia?

Russia is the EU’s main supplier of crude oil, natural gas, and solid fossil fuels. In 2020, almost 30% of crude oil imports came from Russia, according to the European Commission. Russia was also responsible for 43% of natural gas imports and 54% of solid fossil fuel imports.

When will the ban go into effect?

The ban still needs to be ratified by the EU’s 27 member states. Michel said the new sanctions could be legally endorsed as early as Wednesday.

“The oil embargo compromise preserves the patina of European unity on Russia,” wrote RBC Capital Markets analyst Helima Croft in a research note. “Cracks in the European response have appeared to grow more pronounced in recent weeks as highly dependent importers, such as Hungary, refused to budge in their opposition to the oil embargo.”

The initial ban will initially cover two-thirds of Russian oil, encompassing all the seaborne oil shipped to the bloc. The remaining third of oil imports are delivered through pipelines to countries such as Germany, Poland, and Hungary. Those imports will be phased out throughout the course of the year, pending the final approval from those specific member countries, said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission.

Germany and Poland are expected to follow through by blocking pipeline imports, but it is unclear whether Hungary’s Orbán will change his position and agree to a complete import ban.

What’s the impact on Russia?

A two-thirds reduction in Europe’s imports of crude oil and refined products could cost Russia about $10 billion a year in lost revenue, calculates Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank.

By the end of the year, the sanctions could affect between 1.2 million barrels a day to 1.5 million barrels a day of oil, and about 1 million barrels a day of refined products exports by the first quarter of 2023, estimated RBC’s Croft. This could rise if Germany and Poland phase out pipeline flows, she added.

How will Russia respond?

Russia will need to find other markets for those barrels of oil, analysts say, but that is easier said than done. Leonid Fedun, vice president of the Russian oil company Lukoil, wrote on Sunday in an opinion piece for RBC Daily, a Moscow-based business newspaper, that Russia should move to cut production by 20% to 30% to push prices higher and avoid selling oil at a discount.

“Given alarmingly low products inventories and the scarcity of refining capacity, a preemptive Russian products cutoff could have especially deleterious economic impacts this summer,” Croft wrote.

The Kremlin has yet to release an official statement, but Mikhail Ulyano, a Russian representative to international organizations, tweeted that the country would find other importers.

To date, Asian importers have largely absorbed the additional flows from Russia at a discounted prices, but that could be untenable in the long run as these markets could get to a point of saturation, experts say. Still, demand from China could tick back up as the country moves to ease Covid-19 restrictions after extended lockdowns in certain cities.

How will this affect global oil prices?

Oil prices were higher after the EU’s announcement on Monday. West Texas Intermediate crude, the U.S. benchmark, was up 3.2% to $118.76 a barrel on Tuesday morning in New York. Brent crude, the international benchmark, rose 1.7% to $119.57 a barrel.

There is a good chance that the EU ban will mean higher oil prices last for an extended period, particularly as China reopens following its extended Covid lockdown. Other countries could import some of the Russian oil that the EU is spurning, but believing they could take every barrel seamlessly is “an overly simplistic way to think about oil flow,” wrote Michael Tran, commodity strategist at RBC Capital Markets.

Rerouting the flow of oil would be problematic both for the importers and for other exporters like Saudi Arabia.

“Barrels are not homogeneous and neither are counterparties,” Tran wrote. “Countries, like Saudi, that have strategic multi-decade views on their resources may be reluctant to forego the most important market share in the world to swap for European share.” Saudi Arabia would rather supply Asian countries whose demand for oil is growing than send more oil to Europe, which is moving faster to decarbonize and reduce its oil demand. It is unlikely to sit idly by and allow Russia to take its share of the Asian market.

Russia will almost certainly have to curtail production eventually as it runs out of places to store excess crude. And there simply aren’t enough wells around the world to replace lost Russian crude right now. Saudi Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said last week that the world has less than 2% space capacity left.

Other countries that export oil, such as Mexico and Colombia, are likely to profit from the shift, but U.S. producers are in a particularly strong position to benefit. U.S. companies have stayed disciplined during the recent boom, increasing production slowly and keeping their budgets lean. That means more of each dollar in sales is falling to the bottom line, and eventually gets paid out to shareholders as dividends. Among the biggest winners on Tuesday was EOG Resources (ticker: EOG ), whose stock was up 2.7%.

Oil prices, which took off after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February, have been a significant contributor to inflation in recent months. The EU’s decision could mean that inflation in Europe and across other Western countries “could get worse before it gets better,” wrote Ozkardeskaya, the Swissquote Bank analyst.

Diesel, in particular, has become remarkably expensive as refiners race to keep up with demand. Most U.S. consumers drive gasoline cars, so they don’t see the diesel-price increase at the pump, but they feel the pain nonetheless. Trucking companies add fuel surcharges to their shipments that eventually must be paid by consumers. With oil prices likely to stay high, inflation may take longer to cool.

Sarofim, who became a billionaire, had as good an eye for art as he did for stocks. Over nearly 60 years, he amassed a large, museum-quality collection including works by John Singer Sargent, Winslow Homer, Edward Hopper, and a variety of abstract expressionists such as Robert Motherwell and Willem de Kooning. It is one of the finest privately held collections in the U.S.

Sarofim began his collection in the 1960s and kept it hidden from the public until an exhibition last year at the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, of which he was a major benefactor. In announcing the exhibition, the museum said the “scope, scale, and quality” of the Sarofim collection made it “a rarity” among those held privately.

One of Houston’s wealthiest men and a longtime pillar of the city’s business and cultural community, Sarofim founded Fayez Sarofim & Co. in Houston in 1958 and remained its chairman and co-chief investment officer until his death. That extraordinary run rarely has been matched in the investment business.

He was known as “the sphinx” for this Egyptian background and for his limited but well-chosen public comments.

On its website, the firm declares: “We are owners of businesses rather than traders of stock.” That Buffett-esque philosophy was reflected in Sarofim’s penchant for owning blue-chip businesses such as Coca-Cola (ticker: KO), Philip Morris, Procter & Gamble (PG), and Exxon Mobil (XOM) for decades, starting in the 1960s.

The firm shifted to leading technology franchises such as Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon.com (AMZN) in the past 10 years.

Fayez Sarofim & Co. held $31.6 billion of stocks at the end of the first quarter, Bloomberg data show. A Sarofim spokeswoman didn’t have an immediate comment about the firm’s total assets under management.

A good chunk of Sarofim’s wealth came from investments he made alongside clients in companies such as Philip Morris—now Altria (MO) — and Philip Morris International (PM) and Coke.

He rarely gave interviews, and one of his few in the past decade was with Barron’s in 2013, when he reflected on his long career and investment philosophy. “It takes a foreign-born person to appreciate the United States, and the ability of the American people to adapt,” Sarofim said over lunch with this reporter at the wood-paneled Coronado Club in Houston.

Enjoying a cigar and an espresso, he stated his dislike for trading. “Nervous energy is a great destroyer of wealth,” he said.

At that time, he wanted to continue working. “I’m like Buffett,” he said. “Retirement is not in my vocabulary.”

The firm’s offices in downtown Houston had hundreds of paintings from his collection on the walls. In his own office, Sarofim hung one of his most valuable works, a small El Greco masterpiece from the late 16th century, The Crucifixion, one of the few works by the artist in private hands.

Most of the firm’s money is run for institutional investors and high-net-worth clients. The firm’s chief retail vehicle is the $2.2 billion BNY Mellon Appreciation fund (DGAGX).

The mutual fund’s largest holdings are Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com, Chevron (CVX), and Visa (V). Reflecting Sarofim’s buy-and-hold approach, the annual turnover ratio, at 4%, is among the lowest in the fund industry. The fund is ahead of the S&P 500 over the past three and five years, but behind the index during the past 10 years.

Of his penchant for great franchises, Sarofim told Barron’s: “People always look for the needle in the haystack. Why not buy the haystack?”

Sarofim’s patriotism reflected his only-in-America success story. “Here’s an Egyptian who came here with nothing, went to Harvard Business School, and made a fortune in Houston. Not New York, Houston,” Byron Wien, vice chairman of Blackstone Advisory Partners, told Barron’s for its 2013 profile of Sarofim and his firm. “He’s a warm and wonderful person. He has a quality that is so critical in business, which is to make you feel important.”

Sarofim told Barron’s that Houstonians called him a fly by night after he opened his firm in 1958. At that time, there were few independent equity management firms, let alone one run by a 30-year-old Egyptian immigrant with no real track record. The investment business then was dominated by New York banks and Boston firms such as Loomis Sayles and Scudder Stevens & Clark.

Sarofim’s fortunes turned in the early 1960s, when he married Louisa Stude, the adopted daughter of Herman Brown, a founder of the Brown & Root construction company. At that time, Brown & Root had close ties to the most powerful man in Texas, Vice President Lyndon Johnson, a relationship detailed in Robert Caro’s biographies of LBJ.

The Brown family was well connected in Houston, and Sarofim soon was running money for the Rice University endowment, a client of the firm at the time of our 2013 profile. Sarofim had three marriages and two messy divorces that were chronicled in the Houston press. He married Susan Krohn, his third wife, in 2015.

Sarofim’s son, Christopher Sarofim, is vice chairman of the firm, which has many long-tenured investment managers. Fayez Sarofim’s intention in 2013 was for the firm to remain privately held after his death. There was no immediate comment from a firm spokeswoman on the firm’s future.

Sarofim also was part of a group that brought a pro football team, the Houston Texans, back to the city in 2002 after the Oilers left town for Tennessee.

That investment, which he jokingly called a “civic duty,” has worked out well, with the team valued at $3.7 billion, according to Forbes. The group paid $500 million for the franchise rights.

Sarofim’s favorite sport was tennis, and he sponsored the U.S. men’s clay courts championships in April in River Oaks, the tony Houston neighborhood where he lived.

21,Y-mAbs Therapeutics Shares Rise 9% After Biologics License Application Approved,,"By Chris Wack

Y-mAbs Therapeutics Inc. shares were up 9% to $12.70 after the company said Tuesday that the biologics license application for Omblastys omburtamab for the treatment of pediatric patients with CNS/leptomeningeal metastasis from neuroblastoma has been accepted for priority review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The FDA set an action date of Nov. 30, 2022, under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, and indicated it is planning to hold an advisory committee meeting in October 2022 to discuss the application, Y-mAbs said.

Omblastys has a rare pediatric disease designation which, if approved, will provide Y-mAbs with a priority review voucher.

Researchers at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center developed omburtamab, which is exclusively licensed by MSK to Y-mAbs. As a result of the licensing arrangement, MSK has institutional financial interests in the compound and in Y-mAbs.

24,"Avadel Pharmaceuticals Shares Drop 12%, Giving Back Some Friday Gains",,"By Chris Wack

Avadel Pharmaceuticals Plc shares gave back some of Friday's big gains, dropping 12% to $2.20.

The stock more than doubled on Friday, in turn bouncing back from the 52-week low of $1.05 hit on Thursday.

The company said in a filing on Thursday that it received a proposed final label and medication guide for lead drug candidate FT218 from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration.

The stock moved higher Friday after Oppenheimer analyst Francois Brisebois said Thursday's move lower was an overreaction, and the proposed final label and medication guide for FT218 is a positive, as it gives confidence in the product's approvability.

In their note Friday, Oppenheimer reiterated its Outperform rating, but decreased its price target to $13 from $16 a share.

On Tuesday, analysts at Needham dropped their price target to $6 from $14 a share, while maintaining a Buy rating.
