Photograph: Thomas Kienzle/AFP/Getty Images Volkswagen (VW) Volkswagen settles UK \u2018dieselgate\u2019 claims with \u00a3193m payout Claimants in England and Wales to receive more than \u00a32,100 each after joining legal action against carmaker Jasper Jolly @jjpjolly Wed 25 May 2022 11.40 EDT Share on Facebook\n\nShare on Twitter\n\nShare via Email\n\nVolkswagen has agreed to pay \u00a3193m to settle 91,000 legal claims in England and Wales linked to the \u201cdieselgate\u201d emissions scandal that rocked the German carmaker.\n\nThe claimants will receive average payments of more than \u00a32,100 each after joining the action that alleged cars made by Volkswagen group, including its Audi, Seat and Skoda brands, emitted more nitrogen dioxide than the company claimed. The high court in London dismissed the proceedings on Wednesday after the settlement.\n\nThe carmaker will also pay out an amount thought to be in the tens of millions of pounds to cover the claimants\u2019 legal costs, as well as other fees thought to include the costs levied by investors who backed the legal actions.\n\nThe dieselgate scandal erupted in 2015 after Volkswagen was found to have installed illegal \u201cdefeat devices\u201d to cheat emissions tests. It has become one of the costliest corporate scandals in history. The company has spent more than \u20ac30bn (\u00a326bn) in legal fees and payouts to customers, including a $15bn (\u00a312bn) settlement in the US. A fraud trial of the former VW chief executive Martin Winterkorn has been delayed because of his ill health.\n\nVolkswagen did not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. In a press release it said settlement was the \u201cprudent course of action commercially\u201d to avoid the legal cost of a six-month trial and possible appeals. The company believes too much time has passed since the scandal emerged in 2015 for other owners to bring claims, although there are two other British claims in the early stages of litigation.\n\nA series of other carmakers face litigation for similar claims in the UK, including Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover, Stellantis, Nissan, Renault, Ford and Volvo. The total number of claimants in the country is thought to be well over 1 million.\n\nPhilip Haarmann, VW\u2019s chief legal officer, said: \u201cThe Volkswagen Group is pleased that we have been able to conclude this long running litigation in England and Wales. The settlement is another important milestone as the Volkswagen Group continues to move beyond the deeply regrettable events leading up to September 2015.\u201d\n\nVolkswagen has already paid out billions in settlements across the world related to dieselgate, but the matter has taken longer in England and Wales because of a different system that does not easily allow for US-style \u201cclass actions\u201d, under which lawyers can take action on behalf of a whole group of claimants without needing their explicit approval.\n\nInstead, the law firms involved have to spend time and money finding claimants and persuading them to sign up. The firms involved were Slater and Gordon, Leigh Day and PGMBM.\n\nTony Winterburn, a partner at PGMBM, said: \u201cThis is a good day for the claimants and is the culmination of five years of hard-fought litigation.\u201d\n\nShazia Yamin, a partner at Leigh Day, said: \u201cThe settlement of this case is important because it was the first case to get going and the first to be settled. It\u2019s a big moment for consumers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really important milestone that when consumers join these claims there can be something at the end.\u201d"

            "content": "Fuel delivery start-up Booster made its name filling up commuters' cars while they were parked at the office. But after the Covid pandemic shifted so many to remote work, Booster CEO Frank Mycroft says, the company ramped up its business refueling commercial vehicle fleets so drivers are ready to go the moment they start a shift.\nTo\u00a0grow\u00a0that business and offer more renewable energy options to customers,\u00a0Booster has raised approximately $125 million in a fresh venture funding round led by Rose Park Advisors, alongside energy and venture firms including Mitsubishi Corp., Renewable Energy Group, Maveron and Madrona Venture Group among others.\n\u00a0\n\nMatt McIlwain, managing director at Madrona, told CNBC he expects Booster to expand geographically with that capital. \"The committed partnerships and contracts they have already will take them to incredible scale,\" the investor said. He also believes a public offering could be possible for Booster in the next two to three years if the company executes as expected.\nMycroft says some of the funding will also go to research and development. Booster is working on ways to recharge fully electric vehicles, including buses and delivery vans, wherever they are parked -- even in dirt lots far from any charging infrastructure.\nElectric vehicle charging should develop into big business for Booster over time, Mycroft says, but today many companies can't afford to convert their fleets to battery-electric models, or the battery-electric vehicles they want to buy aren't even available.\nThe Tesla heavy-duty Semi, for example, has been delayed multiple times with series production expected to begin in 2023. And Rivian recently warned investors that it may not be able to deliver the thousands of electric vans as promised to Amazon due to a legal battle with a supplier.\nFor now, Booster is convincing customers with traditional, diesel-burning trucks to try renewable diesel, or biodiesel which is made from spent cooking oil or other plant-based blends. Alternative fuels like these generate tailpipe emissions, Mycroft acknowledges, but overall they have about one-third of the carbon footprint of traditional fossil fuels.\n\nSince renewable and biodiesel can't be piped in through the same lines that go to gas stations, Booster is key to distribution, says Steve Geskos, managing director at Rose Park Advisors, one reason energy companies are keen to partner with the start-up.\nSince fuel prices have soared this year following Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, biodiesel, renewable diesel and other \"drop-in\" fuels are proving price competitive, Mycroft says. The national average for regular, unleaded gas hit a record $4.60 a gallon, according to AAA as of Wednesday.\nWhile Mycroft is self-aware and doesn't bill his company as a pure climate solution, the CEO says he looks for every opportunity to reduce the negative impacts of transportation on the environment, and to help communities become climate resilient.\nFor example, during the widespread blackouts in Texas last February, Booster delivered fuel to keep fire trucks running, and generators going as long as the grid was down. In preparation for California's wildfire season, Booster is now training drivers in its home state on how to quickly refuel fire trucks used by Cal Fire.\n\"Emergency response is, unfortunately, another growing part of our business,\" Mycroft said.\nThe U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change recommends \"a substantial reduction in fossil fuel use, widespread electrification, improved energy efficiency, and use of alternative fuels,\" in order to limit human-caused global warming, which increases the severity and frequency of extreme weather events."

            "content": "More venture capital keeps trooping into Africa\u2019s B2B e-commerce retail, a space where startups are digitizing informal trade to get thousands of merchants to operate more efficiently.\n\nThis time, it\u2019s a startup that was in the news this January: Namibia-based JABU, whose $3.2 million seed round we covered. Now, the last-mile distribution e-commerce company has received more investment: a $15 million Series A led by Tiger Global.\n\nThe round, which closed sometime in March, is Tiger Global\u2019s second investment in the B2B e-commerce space after backing Wasoko in its mega Series B round. It\u2019s also worth noting that this deal closed before Tiger Global\u2019s reported $17 billion loss during this year\u2019s tech sell-off.\n\nOther investors in this growth round include Box Group, Knollwood and D Global Ventures. Some backers from its seed round: Afore Capital, Oldslip and FJ Labs also doubled down.\n\nFor many years, merchants who own small to medium-sized kiosks and shops across Africa have dealt with logistics issues when ordering their products from wholesalers and distributors. Startups like JABU and several others such as Wasoko, TradeDepot, Omnibiz, MarketForce, MaxAB and Chari have made this process easier via apps and more efficient distribution channels.\n\nWith JABU, merchants can order, stock and pay for their products via Jwallet and expect same-day delivery, the YC-backed company said. In January, the company had over 6,000 merchants using its platform across Namibia, South Africa and Zambia. CEO David Akinin said that number has increased by 50%.\n\nThe company also provides data-driven services such as sales metrics and agent performances to FMCGs brands and banks via dashboards.\n\nIn the end, Akinin said JABU wants to build around its Jwallet, the wallet system currently launched as a standalone product. Jwallet allows merchants in Southern Africa to use their physical flows to offer cash withdrawals and deposit services for their customers. This play is akin to agency banking, a branchless banking system in Nigeria and West Africa where human agents act as ATMs to offer financial services in remote areas. Chari offers an identical offering in Morocco.\n\n\u201cYou can offer your end consumers the ability to withdraw and deposit money into their wallets and bank accounts through JABU,\u201d said Akinin. \u201cSo we\u2019re connecting an API to banks into the interchange, literally to allow someone who received money via the wallet to walk up to a JABU merchant who can use their physical float and withdraw money.\u201d\n\nThere are other working parts of Jwallet. According to the company, drivers who handle distribution for its 232 logistics partners and use the wallet for payments can access asset finance and, for merchants: stock financing. More on the latter, Akinin said he\u2019s betting that the wallet system can provide a more sustainable alternative to the popular BNPL model that other platforms are offering to merchants.\n\n\u201cI think buy now, pay later is an optical illusion. I think there is credit, and there are cash sales, and there\u2019s nothing in between,\u201d Akinin said. \u201cSo, I think it [BNPL] is going to worsen the situation for small businesses, it\u2019s going to create more defaults, generate a culture of bad pay, and it\u2019s going to create real debt at the SME level in Africa, that will be hard to justify.\u201d\n\nHis bias comes from experiencing defaults when JABU tried the BNPL model in the past. Akinin narrated how merchants would use a platform\u2019s BNPL offering, generate revenue, and proceed to pay for the next invoice with this profit or purchase stock from another supplier in an entirely different supply chain.\n\nJwallet circumvents this by partnering with banks to carry out digital payments and creating communities for merchants to save and provide credit lines for each other on the platform. This process also helps merchants build up their transaction histories while they make enough revenue \u2014 from providing financial services to end customers \u2014 to pay back.\n\n\u201cMuch of what we\u2019re doing with our Java wallet is creating an ecosystem around the community and the shop rather than around our balance sheet. We\u2019re excited about that as a product because we\u2019re trying to prove as we scale that there is a different way to engage with shops.\u201d\n\nThe Series A round will see JABU deepen its presence in Southern Africa and expand to new markets like Botswana and Eswatini later this year. Akinin says what differentiates his startup from others is how it is creating a supper and much broadly an ecosystem for small businesses rather than just a marketplace.\n\n\u201cMany businesses like ours are taking money out of the market. We\u2019re trying to build a business that brings products into the market and continues in a journey that has a multiplier effect of moving that money 20 times around that market. And I think that\u2019s the point of building the Java wallet. There will be shared services; other products will stem from this and so will the ability to pay for services and products in those markets.\u201d"

The move is the latest leg higher in what's been a blistering rally for natural gas as Russia's war on Ukraine sends energy markets reeling.\n\nDavid Givens, head of natural gas and power services for North America at Argus Media, pointed to three key catalysts fueling the rally: little production growth, high liquified natural gas exports, and storage levels that are roughly 17% below the five-year average.\nRapidly rising prices are adding to inflationary pressures across the economy. Drivers are already grappling with record high prices at the gas pump, and now utility bills are set to increase too. While utility companies might have once switched to coal as a cheaper alternative, coal-fueled power is also now in short supply with a number of plants going offline due in part to ESG \u2014 environmental, social and governance \u2014 concerns.\nCampbell Faulkner, senior vice president and chief data analyst at OTC Global Holdings, said the drought in the Western U.S. has curtailed hydropower production.\n\"[G]as is being forced to fulfill a significantly greater portion of power burn during a summer that looks to top records for electricity load,\" he said.\n\"Gas for many years was the waste by-product of continued shale drilling across producing basins in the U.S. which kept prices unusually low. Since the 2020 low in drilling, the market has been pushed into a tight supply demand situation which will not be remedied quickly,\" he added.\n\nNatural gas is now up nearly 30% in May, the third straight month when gains have topped 20%, and prices are now up around 150% for 2022.\nLoading chart...\nLoading chart...\n\nSome of Wednesday's trading action could also be thanks to the futures contract's expiration on Thursday.\n\"Trader positioning around today's June contract options expiration and tomorrow's final settlement is likely to dominate immediate-term trading, particularly later in the session,\" EBW Analytics said in a note to clients.\n\"With ill-defined technical resistance to the high side, the potential for fireworks carrying NYMEX natural gas futures steeply higher over the next two days remains,\" the firm added.\nStill, the more actively traded contract for July delivery also sat above $9 on Wednesday.\nThe S&P energy sector gained more than 1% on Wednesday and is hovering around the highest level since November 2014."

TSLA stock tumbled to a 10-month low, bullish sell-side analysts who had rallied behind the company and saw it as one waiting to explode began to backtrack.\n\nSome of them still remain committed to their Buy ratings but have tempered their expectations concerning the electric vehicle stock's trajectory.\n\nThe following are the recent downward Tesla price target adjustments from analysts.\n\nDaiwa Securities analyst Jairam Nathan reduced the price target from $1,150 to $800, a 30.4% cut. The analyst maintained an Outperform rating.\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives lowered the price target from $1,400 to $1,000, down about 28.6%. The analyst maintained an Outperform rating.\n\nPiper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter stayed at Overweight but reduced the price target for shares from $1,260 to $1,035, down about 18%. This represented a back-to-back cut following a downward revision from $1,350 in April.\n\nWells Fargo Securities analyst Colin Langan lowered the price target from $960 to $900, down 6.25%. The analyst has an Equal-weight rating on the stock.\n\nRelated Link: How Much Wealth Did Elon Musk Lose In This Week's Tesla Stock Rout?\n\nShanghai At Front, Center Of Price Target Cuts: Giga Shanghai's importance to Tesla can't be emphasized enough. The company's China manufacturing plant has delivered volumes at better margins, a function of the affordable manpower available in the country.\n\nIt therefore comes as no surprise to see analysts pumping the brakes amid the three-week shutdown of the plant in April and a subsequent slow ramp. Daiwa's Nathan attributed his price target cut primarily to the uncertainty around Tesla hitting its 50% volume growth target in 2022.\n\nThe analyst expects said he expects a production loss of 70,000 units in the second quarter and another 35,000 units in the third quarter.\n\nCiting the impact of the Shanghai lockdown and the slower ramp-up expected at Giga Texas and Giga Berlin, the analyst now models deliveries of 1.2 million for 2022, representing 30% growth.\n\nA Wedbush analyst termed the Shanghai situation as an \"epic disaster.\" The firm expects softness in deliveries in the June quarter and a slower growth trajectory in China in the second half.\n\nMeanwhile, Wells Fargo's Potter based his action on COVID-19-related weakness in China and fixed cost deleveraging.\n\nAs outlined by Daiwa's Nathan, Tesla is facing other risks as well. The uncertainty surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk's deal to buy Twitter, Inc. TWTR will pose risks to the stock trajectory, he said.\n\nRelated Link: Should Tesla Initiate A Buyback Amid Stock Slump? Here's What One Of Its Biggest Shareholders Thinks\n\nTesla's Bull-Bear Debate: Following the recent sell-off, Tesla backers have suggested the stock weakness presents an attractive buying opportunity. The company has a few second-half catalysts capable of lifting the sagging stock. These include a potential stock-split announcement and the AI Day scheduled for mid-August.\n\nThe average analyst price target for Tesla, according to TipRanks, is $937.45, suggesting scope for roughly 50% upside from current levels. From a technical standpoint, the 14-day relative strength index of the stock is at 35 \u2014 a level consistent with oversold condition.\n\nThe blow dealt by the Shanghai shutdown can't be brushed aside, and the global economic outlook is far from encouraging. Consumer confidence has plummeted, dragged by inflation worries and fears concerning monetary policy normalization. This will begin to manifest in consumer purchasing.\n\nTesla, though it is considered to be more than an electric vehicle company, has no option but to fall back on its mainstay car-making business. For Tesla stock to plot a turnaround, it has to show evidence that production plans are back on track.\n\nTSLA Price Action: Tesla shares were trading 2.45% higher at $643.55 Wednesday morning, according to Benzinga Pro data."

            "content": "Tesla's CEO, the world's richest man, is increasingly commenting, and acting, on matters of global concern.\n\nElon Musk can't get a particular problem out of his head.\n\nHe runs several companies -- two of which, Tesla (TSLA) - Get Tesla Inc Report and SpaceX, are leaders in their respective fields of electric vehicles and space tech.\n\nMusk is further occupied with his hectic $44 billion acquisition of microblogging site Twitter (TWTR) - Get Twitter, Inc. Report.\n\nAnd he (and investors) are contending with the more than 40% drop in Tesla's shares since January. As of May 24 that's knocked more than $77.6 billion off his personal fortune, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nStill and all, the man finds time to worry about other issues.\n\nFor a few weeks now the tech tycoon has been sounding the alarm about the continued decline of populations in wealthy countries due to collapsing birth rates.\n\n\"At risk of stating the obvious, unless something changes to cause the birth rate to exceed the death rate, Japan will eventually cease to exist,\" Musk posted on Twitter on May 7 TheStreet reported at the time. \"This would be a great loss for the world.\"\n\nThe headquarters country of Sony (SNE) - Get Sony Corp. Report and Toyota (TM) - Get Toyota Motor Corp. Report recently said that the population in 2021 declined by 644,000 from a year earlier to 125.5 million people. And 2021 marked the 11th consecutive year of decline.\n\nMusk Fears Extinction of Italy's Population\n\nSince then, Musk hasn't stopped posting messages that raise alarms about declining population and that celebrate children. This problem has become a personal concern. During Twitter exchanges on May 24, the father of seven drew attention to Italy, South Korea and Hong Kong.\n\nItaly's population is aging, according to official data, and Musk fears that the country could die out.\n\n\"Italy. Despite we have a good welfare birthrate is failing \ud83e\udd72,\" posted cybersecurity researcher Andrea Stroppa, with a demographic-trend chart showing the birth rate falling in Italy from 1946 to 2019.\n\n\"Italy will have no people if these trends continue,\" the mogul responded.\n\nThe number of births in Italy fell in 2020 to its lowest level since the country's unification in 1861, according to Istat, the Italian National Institute of Statistics. This was the the 12th consecutive year of decline.\n\nIt stood at 404,892, or 15,192 fewer births than in 2019. The number of deaths rose to 746,146 in 2020 and the population decreased to 59.3 million inhabitants.\n\nThe decline continued in 2021, according to available data from January to September, with 12,500 fewer births over the period than in the first nine months of 2020. The average number of children per woman residing in Italy was 1.24 in 2020, one of the lowest fertility rates in the world.\n\nThe covid-19 pandemic largely explains the drop.\n\nBesides Italy, Musk estimates that the populations of South Korea and Hong Kong are declining at worrying rates.\n\n\"South Korea and Hong Kong are experiencing the fastest population collapse,\" the Tesla CEO wrote.\n\nHe added that with World Bank data showing the countries with the lowest birth rates, \"2.1 kids per woman is replacement rate.\"\n\nDo Rich People Have Fewer Kids?\n\nThe billionaire seems determined to use his platform -- he's currently the most influential CEO in the world, has nearly 95 million Twitter followers and is wooed by politicians -- to shine the spotlight on this issue and push for a broader world reaction.\n\nIn addition to sounding the alarm, Musk also seems to want to buck the conventional wisdom that it's the cost of living that discourages some people from having children.\n\n\"Contrary to what many think, the richer someone is, the fewer kids they have,\" the serial entrepreneur argued. \"I am a rare exception. Most people I know have zero or one kid.\"\n\nWhen Billy Markus, the co-founder of the meme coin dogecoin, observed that \"honestly the major reason for that is people can\u2019t afford to have kids \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f,\" Musk objected.\n\n\"Then why is it that the richer someone is, the fewer kids they have?\" he responded.\n\nMusk also seems unconvinced by the effectiveness of the various policies put in place to try to halt population decline.\n\n\"okay so whyd you come out against Build Back Better which had universal pre-k, childcare investments, child tax credit, paid family leave, etc?\" a Twitter user asked the tech tycoon.\n\n\"None of those programs prove to raise fertility levels,\" another user answered. \"Most European and East Asian countries have all those policies and they have fewer children than we do.\"\n\nAn opinion shared by Musk: \"Exactly!\" he said.\n\nFor him, to solve the collapse of the population, which he describes as \"the biggest threat to civilization,\" we must start by celebrating children.\n\n\"We just need to celebrate having kids,\" he said."

BPCL and other public sector oil companies held petrol and diesel prices for a record duration despite a surge in the cost of crude oil to a 14-year high.\n\nEven though the reopening of the economy during the March quarter saw marketing volumes surge, BPCL was unable to reap the benefits of a strong demand environment as it could not raise prices of retail fuel for the majority of the quarter even as global crude oil prices simmered.\n\nDuring the quarter, global crude oil prices rallied more than 30 percent aided by a strong demand environment in the West and sanctions imposed on Russian oil exports following the country\u2019s invasion of Ukraine in late February.\n\nFor the full FY22 (April 2021 to March 2022), BPCL reported a net profit of Rs 9.076.50 crore as opposed to a net profit of Rs 19,110.06 crore in the previous financial year.

It said these competitive pressures meant it needed a sophisticated pricing model to ensure it could recover its costs over time, or otherwise its business might not be sustainable."

It\u2019s the latest blow to Cerebral, which is facing investigations from the US Department of Justice and the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nCerebral said last week that it was going to stop prescribing controlled substances to new customers, and would transition existing customers off of the service by the fall. The company told The Wall Street Journal that it was \u201cdoing everything possible to ensure these patients get access to medications that their healthcare providers have determined they need.\u201d\n\nDone Health is an ADHD-specific telehealth platform, and like Cerebral, was criticized by nurses who said they were pressured to give out drugs based on only short visits with customers. Some individual CVS locations had already stopped filing prescriptions from some Done clinicians and had questioned them about the amount of ADHD medications they were prescribing. Walmart had also blocked prescriptions from some Done clinicians. Truepill, Cerebral\u2019s reported preferred pharmacy, said this month that it would no longer fill Adderall and other controlled substance prescriptions from the company.\n\nNormally, federal rules require that patients meet with a doctor in-person before they can be prescribed a controlled substance like Adderall. But those rules were relaxed when the United States went under a public health emergency in 2020 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and physicians were able to prescribe the drugs with only a video visit. Companies like Cerebral and Done took advantage of that gap to start offering prescriptions to customers.\n\nThe public health emergency is still in place, so doctors can technically still prescribe controlled substances over telehealth. But most major telemedicine companies, like Teladoc and MDLive, told The Wall Street Journal that they don\u2019t prescribe the drugs. And with pharmacies blocking prescriptions from the ones that do, there are fewer avenues for that easier access to those medications."

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight In fact, Frank Yiannas, the FDA\u2019s deputy commissioner for food policy and response, didn\u2019t learn about the complaint until four months later, according to Yiannas and others knowledgeable about the case.\n\nBy that time, one infant had already died and two others were hospitalized after consuming formula from the plant \u2014 all while other top FDA officials less-versed in food safety had elected not to send new inspectors to the plant in Sturgis, Mich. As another infant death was linked to Abbott-produced formula, the plant closed down and a recall was issued, sparking a critical national shortage of baby formula.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t sent to me and it wasn\u2019t shared with me internally. How does this happen?\u201d Yiannas, who previously ran the food safety program for Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest grocer, told The Washington Post. \u201cThere were early signals and in any safety profession you want to take those seriously to stop the domino effect. That didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe national fallout over the Abbott case has exposed a fractured structure at an agency that has long prioritized drugs and medicine over food safety, experts say \u2014 a problem exemplified by its handling of the whistleblower complaint and other warning signs of problems at the plant.\n\nOn May 22, experts explained how a special military operation is helping to relieve the U.S. baby formula shortage. (Video: Blair Guild/The Washington Post)\n\nNeither of FDA\u2019s food policy divisions have to report to Yiannas and neither do the agency\u2019s food safety inspectors. Instead, they report directly to FDA Commissioner Robert M. Califf, a physician who was appointed to the top post on Feb. 17, the day Abbott recalled many of its powdered products. Before Califf was appointed, food safety problems were reported directly to Principal Deputy Commissioner Janet Woodcock, another physician who was acting commissioner when the whistleblower complaint arrived.\n\n\u201cThe essential thing is that you\u2019ve got three major operating components that are reporting only to the [FDA] commissioner, who, by tradition and current reality is a physician who is focused on medical products and doesn\u2019t have the bandwidth or the inclination to spend time providing the leadership that\u2019s needed for the food program to be successful,\u201d said Michael R. Taylor, who was deputy commissioner for foods and veterinary medicine during the Obama administration.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Wednesday, two House committees will hold separate hearings to investigate the agency\u2019s actions in the Abbott case as well as whether there are deeper structural problems in the agency.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t we act more quickly on the complaints and the whistleblower report? Who knew what when?\u201d Yiannas said. \u201cThose are going to be some of the tough questions that will have to be answered.\u201d\n\nYiannas spoke to The Post after calling back a reporter who stated their name, title and the nature of the story in a voice mail; after repeatedly addressing the reporter by name, Yiannas later terminated the conversation and claimed he did not realize he was speaking to a journalist.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, an FDA spokeswoman declined to comment on Yiannas\u2019s claim about a lag of months in learning of the whistleblower\u2019s report. She said that Califf will testify in the hearings about the agency\u2019s response to the formula crisis.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cOnce the immediate public health risk is minimized, the FDA will conduct a programmatic review to ensure the maximum effectiveness of agency programs and policies related to infant formula and special medical food complaints, illnesses and recalls,\u201d the spokeswoman wrote.\n\nAbbott said there is not clear evidence that the contamination affecting babies originated at its plant. \u201cAfter a review of all available data, there is no conclusive evidence to link Abbott\u2019s formulas to these infant illnesses,\u201d the company said in a statement.\n\nOrganizations representing consumers, the food industry and state food regulators are pushing to restructure the FDA. In April, the groups sent a letter to Califf, calling on him to unify the entire FDA food program under Yiannas and to maintain that structure with his successors.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMeanwhile, Yiannas said he continues to be cut out of the FDA\u2019s oversight of the Abbott facility. He began work on a corrective action plan for Abbott in February, but said he was told to \u201cstand down\u201d by Woodcock.\n\nThe FDA disputed that Woodcock gave such an order, and also Yiannas\u2019s claim that he hasn\u2019t been given oversight of the facility\u2019s reopening process. The agency said he is managing an agencywide group working to address the formula crisis.\n\nLawmakers have expressed concern at Woodcock\u2019s role in the FDA as it works with Abbott to address the safety issues to reopen its plant. Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.) in a hearing called Woodcock \u2014 who received the whistleblower complaint and was heading the agency as officials failed to act on it for months \u2014 a \u201cfox in the hen house\u201d and said it appeared she was playing a leading position in the Abbott plant review. (The FDA also disputes that Woodcock is overseeing efforts to reopen the plant.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTom Neltner, chemicals policy director for the Environmental Defense Fund, who has been working with the agency to eliminate heavy metals from baby foods, said the national formula shortage has been exacerbated because the agency has given authority to officials without training and firsthand experience in the food industry.\n\n\u201cThe FDA\u2019s delays on inspection and acting on the whistleblower complaint made the recall so much worse,\u201d he said of the shortage. \u201cThey didn\u2019t understand that the Sturgis facility was such a dominant source and that they would need to backfill formula from other sources.\u201d\n\nThe Sturgis plant has experienced food safety problems in the past. In September 2010, the company issued a recall of some of its Similac powered infant formula after beetles and beetle larvae were found in the finished formula, which was produced at the plant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe following month, FDA went into the plant to investigate and cited the company for several food safety violations and a \u201cfailure to manufacture foods under conditions and controls necessary to minimize contamination,\u201d public records from the agency show.\n\nAfter that, the Abbott facility passed annual inspections for nearly a decade without any serious food safety findings, agency records show.\n\nThat changed in 2019. During a routine inspection that year, FDA inspectors learned that Abbott had found the potentially deadly pathogen cronobacter in its finished products. They also discovered plant workers were doing inadequate pathogen testing of formula produced at the plant.\n\n\u201cYou did not test a representative sample of a production aggregate of a powdered infant formula at the final product stage and before distribution to ensure that the production aggregate meets the required microbiological quality standards,\u201d the report read.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInspectors also found the company had received at least 10 complaints from nurses and parents who believed Abbott\u2019s products were making infants sick. One complaint came from a pediatric nurse who said five babies had consumed Similac Sensitive Infant Formula and that \u201call babies were projectile vomiting,\u201d records show.\n\nIn another instance, involving three different Abbott formulas, records show an infant had a seizure and was diagnosed with a bacterial infection from a strain of the cronobacter pathogen.\n\nThe children recovered and, in each case, the company said it investigated and determined their products were not responsible, records show.\n\nDespite these findings, FDA did not issue any restrictions on the plant and closed out the investigation. Inspectors did not return to the plant for two years, records show, and the agency cited the pandemic and the risk of spreading the coronavirus as one of the reasons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn a statement, the FDA noted that \u201cmission-critical inspections when possible were made on a case-by-case basis. \u2026 We can confirm that during the pandemic, the agency conducted a number of inspections of powdered infant formula manufacturers.\u201d\n\nBut not at Abbott\u2019s Sturgis facility.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at the inspection reports, you see FDA not being there during covid, even though they had found serious problems before. That seems crazy, especially for infant formula.\u201d said Bill Marler, a food poisoning attorney who is well known for helping shape federal food safety laws and policies.\n\nAlthough the FDA is understaffed in its inspection ranks, during the height of the pandemic, the absence of inspectors in food plants was a matter of policy. Woodcock signed off on a work-from-home model for inspectors. Meanwhile, food safety problems mounted at the Abbott facility, records show.\n\n\u201cThe untold story is that the FDA took all of their staff out of the field for nearly two years during covid except for \u2018emergency for-cause inspections,\u2019\u201d said Steven Mandernach, executive director of the Association of Food and Drug Officials, the organization responsible for the inspections at the state level. \u201cWoodcock said they did all these inspections, but for two years many food inspectors never left their home \u2014 the states did them.\u201d\n\nHowever, Michigan food inspection records show that state inspectors also did not visit the Abbott plant in 2020. The last time they visited was in October 2019, records show.\n\nMandernach said that during the pandemic, the FDA hired additional staff, but because many of them were stuck at home, inspectors left the agency. \u201cThe FDA has had a huge retention problem,\u201d he said, adding that food investigators or inspectors often are paid dramatically less than medical products investigators.\n\nWhen FDA inspectors ultimately returned to the plant in 2021, they documented a host of new food safety problems at the Abbott plant. Workers were handling raw materials, packing and equipment after failing to properly wash their hands. There was also pitting found in the dryers \u2014 nooks and crannies that had developed over the years where bacteria could lodge and grow. The report concluded that Abbott \u201cdid not maintain a building used in the manufacture, processing, packing or holding of infant formula in a clean and sanitary condition.\u201d\n\nThese and other observations were made by FDA inspectors even though the agency had departed from its routine of conducting \u201csurprise\u201d or unannounced inspections during the pandemic. Records show the agency gave the plant several days notice before inspectors arrived.\n\nDuring their visit, inspectors also learned that Abbott had received 16 complaints from 2019 to 2021 about infants who became ill after drinking Abbott products, agency records indicate. Testing showed it was from bacterial infections, including from salmonella and cronobacter. As with the previous complaints found during 2019 inspection, Abbott said it had determined its products were not responsible.\n\nIn the middle of the inspection, FDA also received its first complaint of a child hospitalized with another bacterial infection from cronobacter sakazakii after drinking formula from the plant.\n\nNone of this prompted the FDA to conduct its own testing of the formulas produced at the facility, records show. The complaints that the company received were also not mentioned in the final notice \u2014 called a 483 \u2014 which would have been reviewed by FDA officials with Abbott management at the close of the inspection. The pitting found in the plant\u2019s dryers was also not mentioned, records show.\n\n\u201cThis really hit me between the eyes,\u201d said Phyllis Entis, a food safety microbiologist of 50 years who reviewed the inspection reports. \u201cHere was this great big flashing red warning light in September. They didn\u2019t mention it in the 483. They didn\u2019t do any additional swabbing or testing. They did nothing about it.\u201d\n\nTaylor, the former FDA deputy foods commissioner, said one of the likely reasons the agency did not take more aggressive action when it found problems at the plant is the agency is still operating under an old set of principles.\n\nThat was supposed to change when Congress passed the Food Safety Modernization Act in 2011, which aimed to radically shift the FDA to a model that prevents food poisoning outbreaks.\n\nInspectors were supposed to identify potential food safety problems \u2014 and demand corrections \u2014 to keep bacterial contamination from spreading in food plants. Instead, Taylor said inspectors continue to take aggressive action mostly in cases in which the company\u2019s conduct has already led to serious food-borne illnesses.\n\n\u201cThey still need to shift from this historic reaction to a culture of prevention,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWhat happened with the infant formula illustrates that.\u201d\n\nStructural changes made under the Trump administration further hampered communication in the agency, Taylor said. While Taylor was at the FDA, the two divisions for human and animal food products \u2014 the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition and the Center for Veterinary Medicine \u2014 reported directly to him. This changed during the Trump administration when then-FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, who did not return calls seeking comment, had the two units report directly to him. This structure has not changed under the Biden administration.\n\nWhen FDA inspectors failed to return to the Abbott plant, a former quality assurance worker turned whistleblower on Oct. 19 and 20 mailed to several agency officials hard copies of his report, which DeLauro released at a hearing last month.\n\nHe claimed Abbott purposefully falsified records, released untested formula, employed lax cleaning practices, misled auditors, failed to take corrective measures and lacked good systems for tracing potentially contaminated products, the report shows.\n\nThe whistleblower said that before the 2019 FDA inspection, management authorized the release of some of an infant formula batch that tested positive for microorganisms. After the problem was found, the report alleged, management decided to remove some of formula from distribution but released the rest without additional testing. The whistleblower said that Abbott management was worried that the FDA would find out about the problem during the 2019 FDA inspection and that after the fact, one member of management said she was \u201camazed\u201d that the FDA was unable to discover what had occurred with the tainted batch.\n\nThe former plant worker also described repeatedly bringing up concerns about regulatory violations with management, which he claims ultimately led to his being fired.\n\nAn Abbott spokesperson said the company is reviewing the claims in the whistleblower report.\n\n\u201cThis former employee was dismissed due to serious violations of Abbott\u2019s food safety policies. After dismissal, the former employee, through their attorney, has made evolving, new and escalating allegations to multiple authorities,\u201d Abbott spokeswoman Vicky Assardo said in a statement. \u201cAbbott is reviewing this new document and will thoroughly investigate any new allegations.\u201d\n\nThe whistleblower report arrived at the FDA weeks after a report that a second infant in Minnesota had been hospitalized after allegedly consuming tainted Abbott formula.\n\nFDA officials did not meet with the whistleblower until sometime in December, according to several people familiar with the case \u2014 weeks after receiving the report.\n\nAccording to FDA testimony released Tuesday night in advance of the Wednesday\u2019s hearing, Califf said the agency planned to inspect the facility early in December, but a covid-19 outbreak at Abbott caused a delay, and that a \u201cfailure in FDA\u2019s mailroom\u201d delayed the receipt of the whistleblower\u2019s report by a week.\n\nAs a result, the FDA didn\u2019t begin its inspection until Jan. 31. The following day, FDA inspectors collected samples that confirmed the presence of cronobacter at the plant.\n\nBy then, one infant had died and two had been hospitalized after drinking formula made at the plant.\n\n\u201cThe ignoring of the whistleblower complaint is just stunning to me and underscores the problems with how FDA is structured,\u201d said Marler, the food poisoning attorney. \u201cEveryone got that whistleblower report but Frank Yiannas \u2014 that makes no sense.\u201d\n\nOn Feb. 17, the FDA issued a warning to consumers to not use certain powered infant formulas produced at the Abbott plant. The same day, the company initiated its first in a series of recalls. And FDA received its fourth complaint, involving an infant who died in Ohio after drinking formula made at the plant. The cause of death was cronobacter poisoning.\n\nIt was also the new commissioner\u2019s first day on the job \u2014 eight days since Yiannas first learned of the crisis.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article"

BlackSky's contract is valued at up to $1.02 billion over 10 years, the company disclosed in a filing. Planet's contract value was not immediately available.\n\nNRO touted the contracts as \"a historic expansion\" of its acquisition strategy, noting the increasing availability of commercial companies' imagery \"increases our resilience and enables an integrated approach\" to national security. The NRO is the U.S. agency that manages a wide breadth of satellite-intelligence capabilities, including operating its own classified satellites.\nBlackSky shares soared over 99% in trading while Planet's rose 14% and Maxar's climbed 20%, from the stocks' previous closes of $1.18 a share, $5.02 a share and $24.48 a share, respectively.\nThe NRO award comes under its Electro-Optical Commercial Layer, or EOCL, program, which the intelligence agency says will support over 500,000 federal users over the next decade.\nThe EOCL deal has been long-awaited, with Maxar previously serving as the NRO's sole provider of commercially acquired satellite imagery. While Maxar may be losing a lucrative monopoly, Wall Street analysts do not expect the new competition to hurt the company, given the growth in total addressable market for satellite imagery."
