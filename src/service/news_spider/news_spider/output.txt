title Why this investor who paid $650,000 to lunch with Buffett isn't buying or selling stocks right now
text It’s 13-F season, and you’re not going to find many like Guy Spier’s Aquamarine Capital in the first quarter —- zero buys, zero sells. “Pathetic, isn’t it,” quips Spier in an interview.

Spier says he feels less pressure to trade for trading sake after he stopped charging management fees. He also cites the possibly apocryphal study showing that the best investors are actually dead, or alive but inactive. (A spokeswoman for Fidelity Investments, which is widely credited with the research, says the firm is unaware of the study.) And the bigger issue is that he just doesn’t want to sell. “I can always sell Berkshire Hathaway to raise some cash for another investment, but that investment might have a far higher risk profile, and also have significant declines, the way so many friends of mine have [who are] invested in tech.”

Spier’s investments in Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, -1.50% BRK.B, -1.59% account for about a third of his roughly $350 million portfolio, and another major holding is the Daily Journal DJCO, -0.99% , whose portfolio is run by Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett’s sidekick. Spier and fellow investor Mohnish Pabrai once spent $650,000 on a charity lunch with Buffett, which he chronicled in the book, “The Education of a Value Investor.” One potential client told Spier he doesn’t need to pay him to buy Berkshire Hathaway, a criticism Spier accepts. “In my case, the portfolio is everything, to the downside and the upside,” he says. “You take care of the downside through companies like Berkshire, and you try to achieve some upside through other things that could or could not work out.”

He is fully on board with Berkshire Hathaway’s recent push into the oil industry with Occidental Petroleum OXY, -3.77% and Chevron CVX, -2.11% , though he doesn’t directly own any oil company. “The war with Russia has made it utterly clear that we’re not going to get rid of our oil dependence in the next decade or two. And because the industry has been under invested massively, there’s going to be extraordinary returns to people invested,” says Spier.

In what turned out to be a more morbid discussion than planned, Spier says for the last 10 years he has valued Berkshire Hathaway for what it would be if Buffett died or was otherwise incapacitated. He is willing to take the lumps — he estimates a 20% to 30% decline over three to six months after Buffett went away — because of his belief that Berkshire Hathaway would bounce back.

What makes Berkshire Hathaway unique is that its capital from insurance is invested in equities. “And I don’t know of any other insurance company that’s managed to convince the regulators to do that,” says Spier. “It was a 20-year or 30-year project for Warren to show the regulators why this was a better way to be. So I’m not assuming that there’s any extraordinary investment talent after Warren goes away.” Down the road, however, Berkshire Hathaway might lose its special culture without Buffett at the helm. “There is a very special and unique culture there. And that is part of what enables him to generate the returns.”

Some breaking news is that Spier actually has made a transaction this year — he sold Twitter TWTR, -2.85% , a company that along with Google parent Alphabet GOOG, -2.78% he bought during the pandemic, for more than $50 per share. After Elon Musk launched his takeover offer, “I spent about five milliseconds thinking if he were to allow me to come into the private deal, would I do it.” But what was troubling was how quickly the board accepted Musk’s offer, showing there was no alternative bidder in sight. Spier speculates that Musk may be able to negotiate a buyout price in the mid-$30s for Twitter.

Spier has also invested in Alibaba BABA, -3.45% — a big holding for Munger, who gets his Chinese insights from Li Lu, the value fund manager and founder of Himalaya Capital Management. “That doesn’t make it right, but it raises the probability that the conclusions are right,” says Spier. “Like General Motors, what is good for Alibaba is good for China, and what is good for the planet is good for Alibaba,” he says.

“I have this conflict because I don’t like investing in locations which have abuses of human rights, and China has certainly abused human rights, but on the other side they have lifted so many people out of poverty,” he says. If China makes rational decisions, he says, “they will respect the variable interest entities, they will respect providers of capital from other countries.” All that said, the Zurich-based investor says his stake in Alibaba is probably not big enough to have a significant influence on his portfolio, and he isn’t interested in buying more. “There are businesses in the United States that I would invest in before I added to Alibaba, because I just love the United States. It is just the most amazing destination for capital.”

title Netflix lays off 150 workers as executives look to cut costs
text Netflix Inc. is laying off about 150 employees, according to an internal memo sent Tuesday and confirmed by the streaming giant.

Most of the cuts, including some in the executive ranks and in the animation division, are in the U.S., and represent about 1.3% of the 11,300 employees reported at the end of 2021. The cutbacks had been expected since Netflix NFLX, -4.75% reported last month that global subscribers declined by 200,000 during the first three months of the year — its first such drop in more than a decade — and executives said they would look to cut costs.

“As we explained on earnings, our slowing revenue growth means we are also having to slow our cost growth as a company. So sadly, we are letting around 150 employees go today, mostly U.S.-based,” a spokesperson for Netflix said in a statement. “These changes are primarily driven by business needs rather than individual performance, which makes them especially tough as none of us want to say goodbye to such great colleagues. We’re working hard to support them through this very difficult transition.”

Opinion: Everybody seems scared about where streaming is headed, but calm down and see the benefits

Netflix had already shed approximately 25 workers last month, axing members of the editorial staff for in-house publication Tudum that had launched just a few months prior.

“Our revenue growth has slowed considerably as our results and forecast below show,” Netflix executives said in an April quarterly letter to shareholders. “Streaming is winning over linear, as we predicted, and Netflix titles are very popular globally. However, our relatively high household penetration — when including the large number of households sharing accounts — combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds.”

During a subsequent earnings call with analysts, Netflix Chief Financial Officer Spencer Neumann said the company wanted to be “prudent in terms of pulling back on some of that spend growth to reflect the realities of the revenue growth of the business” over the next two years.

Of late, Netflix has felt the pinch of intensifying competition from media giants like Walt Disney Co. DIS, -3.06% , Apple Inc. AAPL, -4.30% , Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +0.11% , and Paramount Global PARA, -1.76% and AT&T Inc. T, -0.61% , all of whom have plunged into the video-streaming market. Netflix has also been hit hard by the war in Ukraine, which resulted in the removal of 700,000 customers in Russia; inflation, which has forced consumers to trim back their streaming use; and the inevitable drop in streaming viewing as COVID restrictions lifted the past several months.

At the same time, Netflix spent $17 billion on content in fiscal 2021.

To drive more revenue, Netflix plans to offer a lower-priced streaming plan that includes advertisements, probably this year, while also looking to crack down on subscribers who share their account with nonpaying viewers.

Though Netflix’s staff reduction is relatively modest, it could have significant impact, Mark Vena, CEO of SmartTech Research, told MarketWatch. The layoff of 70 part-time roles in the company’s animation studio could hinder the delivery of new content, he said, signaling that Netflix is “getting serious about reigning in overall production costs.”

title Retail Sales Data and Latest Earnings Suggest U.S. Isn’t in Recession Just Yet
text Home Depot earnings and retail sales data on Tuesday made one thing fairly clear: The U.S. isn’t in a recession. At least not yet.

Retail sales jumped 0.9% last month and March was revised higher. Home Depot beat earnings expectations and upgraded the outlook. Walmart didn’t do quite as well—it said inflation has started to affect shoppers’ behavior—but the company still beat on revenue. Combine that with a strong jobs report in April and it’s hard to imagine that the unexpected first-quarter gross-domestic-product contraction will be repeated in the second.

This is why Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell doesn’t think it’s time for nuance when it comes to reining in inflation. The Fed is “tightly focused” on making sure price gains slow down “in a clear and convincing way.”

Now, most of the current inflation is being driven by higher energy and food costs, which the Fed can’t really control. The only way for the Fed to bring the headline inflation rate down is to clamp down on demand—in other words, to stop shoppers from spending so much at stores.

It will take time for the Fed hikes to make an impact, but it looks like consumers aren’t afraid that their real incomes are about to collapse, or that they should be saving up for a rainy day.

Investors are worried that the Fed will do too much. That the “soft landing” Powell is aiming for is too difficult a target to hit. But his starting point is ideal in that there is room for consumption to slow without bringing the whole economy to a screeching halt.

They say that most of what you worry about never happens. Maybe a recession this year will be something to add to that list.

Powell: Fed Has ‘the Tools and the Resolve’ to Cool Inflation

Powell said the central bank needs to see inflation coming down in a “clear and convincing” way but told The Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything Festival on Tuesday that “we have both the tools and the resolve” to get the job done.

Powell signaled that the central bank would likely follow this month’s half-percentage-point interest-rate increase with similar moves at its meetings in June and July. The Fed hasn’t raised rates in such large increments since 2000.

Powell cited the underlying strength of the economy, saying the labor market is “extremely strong” and while economic growth this year might be lower than initially projected, it is still at healthy levels as is consumer spending.

as is consumer spending. Retail sales, including spending in stores , at restaurants and at online sellers, climbed by a seasonally adjusted 0.9% in April from the previous month and 8.2% over 12 months. That is on top of its revised March retail sales increase of 1.4%, up from 0.5%.

That is on top of its revised March retail sales increase of 1.4%, up from 0.5%. Powell said he hopes the Fed can cool inflation and preserve a strong labor market, but that could cause the current 3.6% unemployment rate in April to tick higher. He said the natural unemployment rate consistent with stable inflation “does appear to be well above 3.6%.”

What’s Next: Russia’s war on Ukraine has raised food and energy prices to record highs, and Covid-19-related lockdowns in China are preventing supply chains from healing, Powell said. Those are contributing uncertainty and adding to the “degree of difficulty of what was already a challenging project.”

Sweden, Finland Formally Apply to Join NATO

Sweden and Finland have formally applied to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, in a move that would end decades of neutrality by the two Nordic countries and represent a major geopolitical shift in Europe’s security architecture.

Sweden and Finland’s NATO ambassadors personally handed their countries’ accession requests to NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg in Brussels Wednesday morning, who warmly welcomed the applications, saying they are an “historic step.”

The applications must now be judged and approved by all 30 members of the alliance before Sweden and Finland can be accepted. The process is estimated to take four to 12 months .

. However, Turkey has objected to the two countries becoming members of NATO because of their perceived inaction against exiled Kurdish militants. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Monday that Moscow didn’t see Swedish and Finnish NATO membership as a direct threat, but warned that deployment of military infrastructure on their territories would provoke a response from the Kremlin.

What’s Next: President Joe Biden will host Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson and Finnish President Sauli Niinistö at the White House for a meeting on Thursday to discuss their bids to join NATO, as well as European security more broadly. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Tuesday that the administration is “very confident” that an agreement would be reached for the two countries to join the alliance.

Apple Pushes Back 3-Day Office Return Amid Covid-19 Spike

Apple isn’t going to require workers to return to its offices three days a week starting next week after another spike in Covid-19 cases, delaying yet again an attempt to return to prepandemic normalcy, though it did ask workers to return twice a week.

Employees had already been pushing back against returning from their remote work arrangements. Workers who do go to offices are asked to wear masks in common areas and elevators, and retail workers at 100 of its stores will have to put masks back on, Bloomberg reported.

United Airlines Updates With Positive Travel Outlook

United Airlines expects passenger revenue in the second quarter to climb 23% to 25% over 2019 levels as travel demand continues to improve. That would be a bump up from the 17% gain it forecast earlier, which it characterized as its strongest second-quarter revenue guidance ever. Shares jumped 7.9%.

CEO Scott Kirby told CBS Mornings on Tuesday that United’s flying schedule is 13% smaller than it was before the pandemic. The company will slowly return capacity but the key to readiness is not getting ahead of what the system can support right now, he said.

Dear Quentin,

I am 33 years old. I currently make just over $120,000 a year, including an annual bonus, and my company has gifted me with around $300,000 in equity in the firm, although our stock is brand new, so it is constantly swinging up and down. I put around 6% towards 401(k) and another 4% towards personal savings, investments, and emergency cash.

As far as debt is concerned, I have around $35,000 in student loans, $5,000 in credit-card debt, and $16,000 in personal loans. I do not have a car payment. I help partially support my partner of 12 years as his business is, sadly, failing, but he will not let go of the business. So, some of my income goes to helping him cover bills and expenses.

The big question is, should I sell my company equity to pay off my debt? Or, should I continue to pay off my debt and allow my stock to grow? I realize I would have to pay some fairly large taxes due to the gains on the stock, so I need to factor that into the sale as well. Thank you so much for your input, and thank you for your column.

title ‘Celebrating that your job gets to live in your house rent-free’: Remote work has fueled U.S. house prices during the pandemic — so what happens when people return to the office?
text Remote work has played a big part in the rise in house prices in the U.S. during the first two years of the pandemic, but just how much?

Many fortunate people have had the freedom to live wherever they choose during the pandemic. John Mondragon, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Johannes Wieland, an associate professor from the Department of Economics at the University of California, San Diego, published a paper this week with a bold conclusion: The shift to remote work explains over half of the 23.8% national house price increase between 2019 and November 2021.

The researchers wrote: “​​Our results imply a fundamentals-based explanation for the recent increases in housing costs over speculation or financial factors, and that the evolution of remote work is likely to have large effects on the future path of house prices and inflation.” The paper was distributed Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

The rise in house prices has pleased those who are able and willing to sell, but caused heartache for millions of first-time buyers who yearn to get a foot on the property ladder.

Home prices soared 15.6% year over year in April, reaching a median price of $424,824, according to Redfin RDFN, -5.42% . On average, the number of homes sold fell to 545,706, a decline of 13.2% from the prior year.

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.3% for the week ending May 12, according to data released by Freddie Mac FMCC, -2.29% . To put that in context: The average rate hovered at 2.94% a year ago.

A recent poll from Gallup found that only 30% of Americans believe now is a good time to buy a house. It’s the lowest level on record since Gallup began surveying Americans on this question beginning in 1978, and it’s the first time less than 50% of people across the country thought it was a good time to buy.

Housing costs — which can take up a third of a family’s take-home pay for a middle-income household — have increased by 5.1% in the past year, the fastest annual pace since 1991, while rents are up 4.8% from a year ago, according to the Labor Department.

Another speed bump for employers, if not for housing markets where people fled during the pandemic: There is a reluctance to return to the office among many employees. As one working-from-home employee wrote on Twitter TWTR, -2.81% : “Both of these things are true: the push for returns to the office is absolutely a capitalist death march/celebrating that your job gets to live in your house rent free without compensation is clown s***.” Another wrote: “We want people to return to the office so those building aren’t abandoned and he’ll be forced to house the unhoused in all them empty buildings!!!!”

A group that calls themselves “Apple Together” signed an open letter to the company, claiming 1,400 signatures from workers. “We are not asking for everyone to be forced to work from home,” they wrote. “We are asking to decide for ourselves, together with our teams and direct manager, what kind of arrangement works best for each one of us, be that in an office, work from home, or a hybrid approach. Stop treating us like school kids who need to be told when to be where and what homework to do.” (Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment.)

The latest NBER research details the relationship between remote work and house prices. “Using variation in remote work exposure across U.S. metropolitan areas we estimate that an additional percentage point of remote work causes a 0.93% increase in house prices after controlling for negative spillovers from migration,” the authors wrote. “This cross-sectional estimate combined with the aggregate shift to remote work implies that remote work raised aggregate U.S. house prices by 15.1%.”

But the rise in house prices could reverse as people return to the office. CoreLogic predicts that home prices will slow to a 5% growth rate in 2023, while Fannie Mae FNMA, -0.40% sees a more tepid 4.2% growth next year.

“Our results also imply that the future path of housing costs may depend critically on the path of remote work,” the NBER paper added. “If remote work reverses, then there may be a general reversal in housing demand and potentially house prices. If remote work persists, we may expect important repercussions as increased housing costs feed into inflation and so affect the response of monetary policy.”

But the response was so overwhelming that the company said it became challenging for its system to keep pace with demand, resulting in some customers being unable to place orders.

“We saw an unprecedented amount (of orders), more than we’ve seen before with any promotion,” said Grubhub spokesman Christopher Krautler.

At some points, Krautler said Grubhub was trying to process 6,000 orders per minute from its New York customers.

The technical issues were resolved later during the 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. offer period, Krautler said. But even then, participating restaurants were backed up delivering orders because of the sheer volume.

Richie Romero, a proprietor of Zazzy’s Pizza, a Manhattan restaurant with three locations, said his Wednesday lunchtime business was 30 times higher than normal because of the promotion. He was still trying to deliver some orders as late as 2:45 p.m.

“It was monstrous,” he said of the surge, adding that he had to bring on extra staff to handle the orders. Not that Romero was complaining: He anticipated getting plenty of new customers because of the promotion.

Romero added that the promotion clearly struck a chord at a time when diners are feeling the financial pinch.

“With inflation, people just want a good deal,” he said.

Still, some New Yorkers couldn’t help but express their frustration on social media with the problems placing orders. But a few at least found humor in the situation.

Grubhub said it would assist customers who experienced any issues. “Our customer care team is working with those folks to offer a $15 credit,” Krautler said.

Manhattan resident Dallas J. Short said he had trouble placing an order initially. But he eventually got the app to work and was soon rewarded with a free lunch of vegan nachos.

“It’s something I would buy again, and I’m not even vegan,” he said.

As MarketWatch documented in the fall of 2021, online orders at many restaurants “have become part of a crushing new reality” even on days when there aren’t promotions. This is due to more people ordering take-out because of the pandemic, and more people ordering food via apps.

title Berkshire's Buys of Citi, Paramount Boosted Their Stocks, But Was It Buffett Buying?
text Who’s doing the buying at Berkshire?

Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK.A, BRK.B) disclosed a slew of equity purchases during the first quarter in a regulatory filing late Monday, including new holdings of Citigroup and Paramount Global.

Both stocks have rallied Tuesday on news of the Berkshire buys, in part because of the imprimatur of CEO Warren Buffett. Citigroup (C) is up 6.7% to $50.64, and Paramount (PARA) is 12% higher to $31.37, with both besting peers in the stock market. Another purchase was Celanese (CE), whose shares are up 8.4% to $156.76.

But there’s a reasonable chance these purchases were made by Buffett’s two investment lieutenants, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, who together run about $35 billion of Berkshire’s total equity portfolio of $400 billion. Buffett runs the rest.

Many of Berkshire’s smaller holdings of $3 billion or less likely are theirs, although Buffett doesn’t delineate which equity investments are his and which are made by Combs and Weschler. The Citigroup holding of 55 million shares is worth $2.8 billion, and the Paramount stake of 69 million shares is worth $2.1 billion. Berkshire didn’t return Barron’s request for comment.

One reason to doubt that Citigroup is a Buffett investment is that Buffett sold a group of bank stocks in Berkshire’s portfolio in 2020 and 2021, including JPMorganChase (JPM) and Wells Fargo (WFC).

Berkshire’s largest holdings, including Apple (AAPL), Bank of America (BAC), Coca-Cola (KO), Chevron (CVX), and American Express (AXP), probably are Buffett’s buys, although there could be some overlap in the Chevron and Apple holdings with the two other managers.

Berkshire’s first-quarter purchase of Occidental Petroleum (OXY), which now totals nearly $10 billion, probably is a Buffett buy.

Buffett complained at the recent Berkshire annual meeting that the media often attributes any Berkshire purchase to him. “I see headlines in papers just time after time after time that say, Buffett’s buying such and such. Well, I’m not buying such and such, Berkshire Hathaway is buying it. And it may be the work of two other people that work at Berkshire,” Buffett said.

There’s a good chance that Berkshire’s holdings in DaVita (DVA), General Motors (GM), Amazon.com (AMZN), Snowflake (SNOW), Charter Communications (CHTR), RH (RH), and Liberty SiriusXM Group (LSXMA) were bought by either Combs or Weschler. Many of these stocks are trailing the stock market this year.

Buffett told CNBC in 2019 that Combs and Weschler were “a tiny bit” behind the S&P 500 since they joined Berkshire about a decade ago. Barron’s isn’t aware of any newer Buffett comments on their performance since then.

title Paramount Stock Gets Boost from Berkshire Hathaway Investment
text Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett bought a whopping $51 billion of stocks in the first quarter, as the broad stock market tumbled. His contrarian moves included a big bet on Paramount Global, an exceedingly cheap stock in the media industry.

Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK.A, BRK.B) revealed in a regulatory filing on Monday that it owned about 69 million nonvoting shares of Paramount (PARA) at the end of March. That 10.6% stake would be worth about $2.2 billion at Tuesday midday’s $31.90 per share, up 14%.

Paramount has two classes of stock, with the company’s A shares (PARAA) controlling the vote and Class B shares—which Berkshire bought in the first quarter—having no voting rights. The vast majority of the voting shares are controlled by Paramount Global’s chairwoman, Shari Redstone.

Paramount is the product of the 2019 merger of Viacom and CBS, and changed its name from ViacomCBS earlier this year. The rebrand was meant to underline the company’s content assets and its pivot to a streaming-focused business model.

Today’s Paramount is a legacy media company: 85% of first-quarter revenue came from TV, movie theaters, and licensing. Its streaming segment is fast-growing, but losing money as it invests in original content and pursues subscriber scale.

At an investor day in February, management lifted its global subscriber target for its Paramount+ and Showtime services to100 million by the end of 2024, versus 62 million users at the end of the first quarter. Paramount also has the free, advertising-supported service PlutoTV with almost 68 million monthly active users in the first quarter, on the way to management’s target of 120 million in 2024. The company expects streaming revenue to exceed $9 billion annually by that year and for the segment’s losses to peak next year, before declining.

For Buffett, it’s a somewhat uncharacteristic business bet. Streaming is competitive, with seemingly low barriers to entry for those willing to spend big. Paramount has to contend with not only media rivals including Walt Disney (DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), but also technology industry newcomers Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon.com (AMZN).

And the long-term picture for the cable-TV and movie-theater distribution models isn’t pretty.

Buffett may nonetheless see a low-risk bet in Paramount’s cheap stock. The shares trade for just 11.5 times expected earnings over the next four quarters, and carry an annual dividend yield of 3.0%.

Barron’s called the stock “a value investor’s way to play streaming” in a March cover story on the streaming industry. It will depend on management’s ability to pull off its streaming growth strategy.

Analysts and investors frequently bring up Paramount’s potential appeal as a merger or acquisition candidate by a rival media company wanting to bulk up or a tech giant looking to expand its content offerings—likely putting a floor under its valuation. But Buffett doesn’t typically invest based on merger speculation.

Berkshire’s only other current media-industry stockholdings are shares of tracking stocks Liberty SiriusXM Group (LSXMA) and Liberty Formula One Group (FWONA). The company’s largest position is in Apple (AAPL), which has a nascent streaming service AppleTV+.

Buffett got out of the newspaper business in 2020, selling Berkshire’s then-portfolio of several dozen papers to Lee Enterprises (LEE). He had been a longtime investor in the parent company of the Washington Post and famously worked as a newspaper delivery boy while growing up in Omaha, Nebraska.

Buffett’s other big purchases in the first quarter included shares of Chevron (CVX), Citigroup (C), Occidental Petroleum (OXY), HP (HPQ), and Activision Blizzard (ATVI). Berkshire stock has gained 4% year to date, versus a 15% decline for the S&P 500.

title Grubhub is giving NYC office workers free lunch --- but who’s in the office?
text Could giving people free food work up the appetite to return to the office?

GrubHub has been trending on Google throughout the day on Tuesday for offering a free lunch up to $15 for NYC office workers between 11 a.m. and 2 p.m. Workers in the Big Apple’s five boroughs, as well as parts of Long Island and New Jersey, can redeem the deal by using the promo code “FREELUNCH” on the delivery service’s app or website during the promotional period, and they’ll get a $15 credit on qualifying orders. And for those who miss the three-hour window, GrubHub will still dish an additional one-time $5 off for NYC office workers until May 31.

Of course, remote employees who have the luxury of working from home could already be enjoying an almost free lunch today from what they’ve got on-hand in their own kitchens. And while companies including Google GOOGL, -3.12% , Apple AAPL, -4.33% , Citigroup C, -2.54% and Goldman Sachs GS, -1.20% are asking employees to return to the office, they’re being met with some resistance. And many office buildings in major cities are still reporting plenty of vacancies.

In NYC, for example, only 38% of Manhattan office workers are in the workplace on an average weekday as of late April 2022, according to the Partnership for New York City, a nonprofit group representing local business leaders. And just 8% of Manhattan office workers report to the office full-time, five days a week. The group surveyed more than 160 major employers between April 21 and May 4, 2022 to gauge how many of Manhattan’s one million office workers are returning to their workplaces regularly. The verdict: remote work is here to stay, with almost 80% of NYC employers anticipating a hybrid work model moving forward. Compare that to before the pandemic, when just 6% of NYC employers said that a hybrid model of mixing remote and in-office work would be their predominant policy.

Less than half (43%) of white-collar workers in America’s biggest cities (including NYC, Chicago, Dallas, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.), have returned to their offices, according to Kastle Systems. The office security company tracked workers’ badge swipes and keycard usage at more than 2,600 buildings that it manages in 138 cities across 47 states. And New York, San Francisco, San Jose and Philadelphia are well below that 10-city average, with return rates below 40%.

So, many employers are trying to whet workers’ appetites by offering them free food and other benefits. The Partnership for New York City reports that nearly two-thirds (64%) of the employers it surveyed are offering at least one incentive to people who return to the office. The most common include social activities (50%), free or discounted meals (43%), subsidizing transportation (13%) and offering child care support (10%).

And 30% of companies told the Partnership for NYC that they are offering extra remote work flexibility during the summer, such as summer Fridays (when employees get to knock off early to get a jump on the weekend) and permitting remote work in August.

Some tech companies have also been enticing employees to return to the office with some major perks, such as Google giving employees a private Lizzo concert at its Mountain View, Calif. headquarters in April. The chip maker Qualcomm QCOM, -4.97% hosted a happy hour at its San Diego offices when workers returned last month that featured free food and T-shirts. It also started hosting free weekly events like group fitness classes and pop-up snack stations.

Microsoft MSFT, -3.31% also greeted employees who returned to work in February with “appreciation events” that featured lawn games, basket-making classes, and plenty of free food and drinks.

Perhaps it is better to offer employees the carrot (rewards for working in-person) versus the stick (penalties for working from home.) Two-thirds of the workforce said they would find a new job if required to return to the office full-time, according to a survey of more than 32,000 workers by ADP Research Institute. The Wall Street Journal has also reported that of those who quit their jobs during 2021’s Great Resignation, 35% said it was because they wanted to move to a different area.

title Tesla Stock Gets an Upgrade to Hold—and a Price Target Cut
text Tesla stock caught an upgrade. Just not the kind that excites investors. Still, the company lost a bear, and that might yield benefits for shareholders down the road.

Tuesday, Tudor Pickering analyst Matt Portillo upgraded Tesla stock (ticker: TSLA) ti Hold from Sell. He lowered his price target, however, to $723 a share from $824.

Portillo noted the hefty decline in Tesla stock recently as well as better-than-expected gross profit margins as reasons for the upgrade.

Tesla’s reported first-quarter gross profit margin came in at about 29%, several percentage points higher than analysts were projecting. That helped drive a big bottom line “beat.” Tesla reported $3.22 in adjusted earnings per share for the quarter. Wall Street was looking for about $2.30 a share.

Tesla shares were up 2.5%, at $743, in recent trading, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were up about 1.2% and 1.5%, respectively.

The upgrade to Hold doesn’t change the Buy-rating ratio for Tesla stock. It’s at 50%. The average Buy-rating ratio for stocks in the S&P 500 is about 58%.

It does, of course, change the average Sell-rating ratio, which doesn’t get as much attention from investors. Stocks are either Buys or they aren’t. Sells might indicate a short selling opportunity, but most investors don’t sell stocks short. (In a short sale, an investor borrows stock they don’t own and sells it. If the price declines they can buy it back at a lower price and pocket the difference.)

But the Sell-rating ratio does indicate a level of overall bearishness, or a level of controversy, in a stock.

Twenty-five percent of the analysts now covering Tesla rate shares Sell. That is far higher than average. The average Sell-rating ratio for the Russell 3000 Index is roughly 6%.

That’s one way to measure Wall Street controversy. It also shows up in other ways. The spread between the top and bottom Tesla price targets is more than $1,500. That’s more than 200% of the current stock price. The bull-bear spread for Apple (APPL) is about one-third that level, at about $94, or roughly 63% of the current stock price.

Apple is more popular among analysts, with 75% of those covering it rating shares Buy. The Sell-rating ratio for Apple stock is 2%. Only one analyst rates shares Sell.

An upgrade to hold might not excite Tesla bulls, but a declining Sell-rating ratio could signal less volatility down the road. That is something bulls would welcome as well.

Tesla’s annualized volatility is about 68%. Roughly speaking, that’s how much fluctuation an investor can expect in Tesla stock over 12 months. Apple’s annualized volatility is half that, at about 34%.

title Here's what just happened that triggers stock market drops 71% of the time, warns Credit Suisse
text Wall Street’s in an unusually bullish mood Tuesday morning.

Tim Holland, chief investment officer at Orion Advisor Solutions, argues the market has just notched two peaks. Last week, the Labor Department finally reported an ever-so-slight decline in inflation, as a measure of individual investor sentiment showed the greatest percent of individual investors that were bearish since 2009.

“If we have seen peak inflation and peak investor pessimism the path forward for the market should be much more constructive,” said Holland.

Not everyone’s convinced. Credit Suisse’s London-based global strategy team have been cautious on stocks since February — and they still are. They say recession risk remains very high and there isn’t upside on their fair value models. Importantly, the risk to corporate earnings remains high.

“Earnings revisions have started to fall and 71% of the time when this happens, markets fall over the next quarter. Current PMIs imply significant further downside to revisions. We see clear risk of negative EPS in 2023,” said strategists led by Andrew Garthwaite.

Sure, markets have bottomed after a roughly 19.5% drop from their peak — the intraday low on the S&P 500 SPX, -2.86% that was reached last Thursday — but on three of those four occasions, the Fed was easing.

For the Credit Suisse team to turn bullish, it would take, more or less, clear signs that Fed hikes are restraining the economy.

“What do we need to see to be more constructive? Clear signs of U.S. wage growth slowing, U.S. lead indicators falling sharply indicating that the Fed needs to do less to get unemployment rising above full employment, signs of a new paradigm showing that margins can stay high even as nominal GDP slows by [8 percentage points], clear cut undervaluation on [equity risk premium] model, or credit spreads discounting a recession,” Garthwaite and the team said.

The buzz

Hong Kong-listed stocks including JD.com JD, -3.98% , Alibaba BABA, -3.40% and NetEase NTES, -0.32% surged as Shanghai set plans to reopen from its strict lockdown, including a full reopening by June 1.

Elon Musk — over Twitter, of course — said that his offer for the social-media service TWTR, -2.81% cannot move forward until the company provides more details on the proportion of spam accounts. CEO Parag Agrawal says he’s confident that spam accounts represent less than 5% of the user base, and the company said it was “committed to completing” the $54.20-a-share deal in a proxy statement. Separately, Musk may be selling shares in SpaceX to help fund the bid, the New York Post reported.

It’s a big day on the retail front, as Home Depot HD, -4.85% reported a surprise rise in same-store sales growth, but Walmart WMT, -7.10% shares are getting hit by an earnings miss and outlook cut. The April retail sales report showed a 0.9% boost. Industrial production and a homebuilder sentiment report also are due for release.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is due at 2 p.m. Eastern to appear at The Wall Street Journal’s Future of Everything Festival. A slew of regional Fed presidents, from the hawkish James Bullard to the dovish Neel Kashkari, also are due to speak.

A wave of 13-F reports from top shareholders were filed at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Berkshire Hathaway revealed new stakes in Citigroup C, -2.54% , Paramount Global PARA, -1.75% and Celanese CE, -2.16% , among others. Chase Coleman’s Tiger Global Management, which has struggled this year, boosted stakes in several tech plays including CrowdStrike Holdings CRWD, -6.34% , Sea SE, -6.31% , Snowflake SNOW, -5.76% , ServiceNow NOW, -4.11% and Carvana CVNA, -11.71% .

The markets

Markets seem to be flying higher, as U.S. stock futures ES00, -3.02% NQ00, -3.73% rose and the dollar DXY, +0.32% fell.

Top tickers

Here were the most active stock-market tickers as of 6 a.m. Eastern.

The chart

Correlation doesn’t mean causation, and dual Y-axis charts can be manipulated to show closer correlations. So with all those caveats in mind, U.S. economists at Natixis point the close correlation between mortgage rates and house prices, which points to a perhaps sharp wealth effect risk.

They do point out, however, that the steepness of the home price slowdown might not be as sharp as the chart would suggest, owing to the national housing deficit of both the pandemic housing boom and ongoing supply chain issues. A mid single digit correction in house prices over the next year “is entirely reasonable.”

title The 2022 Honda CR-V hybrid vs. the Toyota RAV4 hybrid—which is better?
text The world of hybrid compact SUVs is growing, and two of the top choices are the hybrid variants of the Honda CR-V and Toyota RAV4. Already considered excellent SUVs, they get even better with the improved fuel economy of the hybrid.

Let’s take a closer look at these hybrid compact SUVs and find the right one for you.

2022 Honda CR-V Hybrid

The Honda HMC, -1.50% CR-V Hybrid, which starts at a price of $32,010, is motivated by a gas-electric hybrid powertrain producing 212 horsepower and 232 lb-ft of torque. That gives it more power than the standard, non-hybrid CR-V while returning better fuel economy and giving you the benefit of standard all-wheel drive. Additionally, the EPA rates this SUV at 40 city/35 highway/38 combined mpg.

Honda CR-V Hybrid highlights

Roomy back seats: Both of these SUVs are pretty spacious, but the CR-V has more than two additional inches of rear-seat legroom compared to the RAV4. This is part of what makes the CR-V Hybrid a great SUV for families. Kids and adults alike will be plenty comfortable in the back of the CR-V, plus there’s plenty of cargo space, too.

Honda Sensing: The Honda Sensing suite of driver assistance tech features comes standard on every CR-V Hybrid. This system bundles a collision mitigation braking system, a road departure mitigation system, adaptive cruise control with low-speed follow, and lane-keeping assist system. Blind-spot monitoring also comes standard in the CR-V Hybrid. These features make driving safer and easier, especially on the highway.

Rich interior: We find the CR-V’s passenger cabin more appealing than the RAV4’s. The materials and design convey a warmer, more premium feel, which includes leather-trimmed seats and ambient lighting that’s available in the upper trims.

2022 Toyota RAV4 Hybrid

The Toyota Rav4 hybrid Toyota

The Toyota TM, -1.99% RAV4 Hybrid has a similar powertrain as the CR-V Hybrid. It’s a 2.5-liter hybrid inline-4 that makes 219 horsepower and 163 lb-ft of torque. This is the more fuel-efficient option, returning 41 city/38 highway/40 combined mpg. This SUV also comes standard with AWD and has a starting price of $29,575.

Toyota RAV4 Hybrid highlights

Better fuel economy: Both of these SUVs are fuel-efficient, but the RAV4 Hybrid is the more economical of the two. With a combined fuel economy rating of 40 mpg, the RAV4 Hybrid has super-low fuel costs of only $1,550 per year, according to the EPA. It also comes standard with AWD like the CR-V Hybrid, which is great for drivers in snowy climates.

Lower starting price: The RAV4 Hybrid has a lower starting price than the CR-V Hybrid by over $2,400. It’s also packed with value. Even the base LE trim includes features like AWD, Android Auto, Apple CarPlay, Amazon Alexa, and many safety tech features. In the loaded top trims of these two SUVs, pricing is very similar.

Toyota Safety Sense 2.0: The standard Toyota Safety Sense 2.0 comes with a few extra features over the Honda Sensing system. Safety tech features include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, full-speed dynamic radar cruise control, automatic high beams, lane-departure alert with steering assist, lane tracing assist, and road sign assist.

title Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway reveals new stakes in Paramount, Citigroup
text OMAHA, Neb. — Warren Buffett’s company on Monday revealed all the investment moves it made in the first quarter, when it spent more than $51 billion on stocks.

But Buffett had already shared the biggest investments with Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, -1.47% BRK.B, -1.54% shareholders at the company’s recent annual meeting. That means investors already knew that he had invested heavily in Chevron CVX, -2.12% , Occidental Petroleum OXY, -3.87% and HP Inc. HPQ, -4.95% during the quarter, while picking up nearly 4 million more Apple AAPL, -4.32% shares and betting that Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard will go through.

But Monday’s Securities and Exchange Commission filing also revealed new stakes in Citigroup C, -2.54% , Ally Financial ALLY, -3.72% , media company Paramount Global PARA, -1.75% , insurer Markel MKL, -0.53% , chemical maker Celanese Corp. CE, -2.16% , and pharmaceutical distributor McKesson Corp. MCK, -3.32% .

Berkshire also added 2 million General Motors GM, -4.57% shares to give it 62 million shares of the automaker during a quarter when its cash pile shrank to $106 billion from $147 billion because of all of its stock purchases.

The filing Berkshire submitted Monday doesn’t make clear which moves Buffett made and which investments were made by Berkshire’s two other investment managers. But Buffett typically handles all the company’s larger investments worth more than $1 billion, such as Berkshire’s stakes in Apple, Bank of America BAC, -2.41% and Coca-Cola KO, -4.91% . Buffett and other Berkshire officials don’t comment on these quarterly stock filings.

Recent SEC filings showed that Berkshire continued buying Occidental Petroleum shares after the first quarter ended and it now holds more than 15% of the oil producer’s stock.

In addition to all the new investments, Berkshire did sell off nearly $10 billion in stocks, including trimming its holdings in grocer Kroger KR, -5.50% and Verizon Communications VZ, +0.93% , and eliminating investments in drug makers Abbvie ABBV, -0.54% and Bristol Myers Squibb BMY, -0.35% .

Besides investments, Berkshire owns an eclectic assortment of more than 90 companies, including BNSF railroad, several major utilities, Geico and other insurers, and an assortment of manufacturing and retail companies.

title Trulieve, Ascend Wellness CEOs chart multi-state growth
text CEOs by their nature remain an optimistic bunch, but with more states to offer growth in the adult use cannabis business, the leaders of both Trulieve Cannabis Corp. and Ascend Wellness Holdings Inc. have plenty of room for revenue expansion as these new territories come on line this year.

Trulieve TCNNF, +0.93% TRUL, +0.16% and Ascend Wellness AAWH, -3.74% issued mixed first-quarter results, but with medical and adult use cannabis programs sprouting in several states, the companies directed the spotlight on prospects ahead in Florida, New York, and New Jersey.

Acquisitions remains on the table as well, particularly for Trulieve, which closed the $2.1 billion acquisition of Arizona-based Harvest Health & Recreation Inc. in October as one of the largest M&A deals in the industry.

Trulieve Cannabis on Thursday reported a first-quarter net loss of $32 million, or 17 cents share, from net income of $30.1 million, or 24 cents share in the year-earlier period.

Breaking out items related to its Harvest acquisition and other one-time costs, the company earned a penny a share, below the Wall Street estimate of 3 cents a share, according to FactSet data.

Revenue increased by 64% to $318.3 million, ahead of the $306 million estimate.

The company booked $45.1 million in cash flow from operations and ended the quarter with a cash balance of $267 million, with operations in 11 states.

Trulieve is still expecting full-year revenue of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. The FactSet consensus was $1.34 billion.

With a 26.8% market share in Florida and 115 stores, the Sunshine State continues to offer growth opportunities, CEO Kim Rivers told MarketWatch.

“We’ll continue to grow our Florida footprint – we don’t anticipate it slowing down,” she said.

During the first quarter, the state booked an average of 3,700 new medical cannabis patients per week.

Trulieve remains on track to build up its presence in Maryland and Florida, as well as growth in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, and sees additional investment in Arizona.

Trulieve also continues to look for opportunities to buy smaller cannabis companies in the Southeast, the Northeast and the Southwest.

“We’ll be acquisitive around those hubs and on-board [small] operators within that footprint,” Rivers said. “We have strong balance sheet and proven access to capital and we’ll remain opportunistic.”

Ascend Wellness eyes Big Apple presence

Ascend Wellness on Wednesday said its first-quarter loss narrowed to $27.8 million, or 16 cents a share, from a loss of $48.2 million, or 45 cents a share in the year-ago quarter.

Revenue increased to $85.1 million from $66.1 million.

Ascend Wellness fell short of the Wall Street target for a loss of 3 cents a share and the revenue estimate of $86.4 million, according to FactSet Data.

Ascend Wellness co-founder and CEO Abner Kurtin said the company is bullish about its prospects for adult use cannabis in New Jersey, with one store open and two more on the way in the Garden State.

It’s also gearing up for a bigger presence in New York after reaching a settlement with MM Enterprises USA LLC MMNFF, -6.38% in a lawsuit over the sale of MedMen NY Inc.

Ascend Wellness agreed to hike its purchase price by $15 million $88 million from $73 million to settle the lawsuit filed Jan. 14 between the two cannabis companies.

Even at $88 million, the purchase is much less than the $247 million acquisition of Etain by RIV Capita Inc. CNPOF, -1.10% a unit of Scotts Miracle-Gro Co. SMG, -6.82% , to enter the New York market, Kurtin said.

The MedMen NY deal includes four medical dispensaries in Manhattan, Long Island, Syracuse and Buffalo, plus a cultivation facility in Utica.

“We’re really excited about New York,” Kurtin said. “The seller didn’t like the price, which created the situation.”

Ascend Wellness plans to keep MedMen’s Fifth Avenue retail location, which has been described as the Apple store of weed.

“It’s a great location for locals and for tourists,” Kurtin said.

Shares of Trulieve are down about 44% so far in 2022 as cannabis stocks have weakened in the face of low prospects for federal legalization and overall stock market jitters about inflation and a recession.

Ascend Wellness has fallen 48.8% so far in 2022, while the AdvisorShares Pure Cannabis ETF MSOS, -3.16% is down 44.5%.
