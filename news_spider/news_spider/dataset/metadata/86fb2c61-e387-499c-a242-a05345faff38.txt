summary:The letter, first reported by CNN, urges advertisers to make their next ad deals with Twitter contingent on changes to platform policy under Musk.
"It would be very revealing if Twitter refuses to or does not sign or does not give those cancellation options."
Other organizations spearheading the letter campaign include the technology advocacy organization Accountable Tech and the feminist group UltraViolet.
Last week, according to the Financial Times , Twitter wrote a message to advertisers addressing perceived nervousness about the Musk deal â€” and reassuring brands that Twitter will continue to be a safe place to advertise.
Even if Musk ultimately decides against undoing Twitter's policies, his sole ownership of the company highlights his unaccountable power, said Nicole Gill, co-founder and executive director of Accountable Tech.
