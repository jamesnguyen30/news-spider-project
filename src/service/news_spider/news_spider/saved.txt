The slowdown has recently been exacerbated with a downturn in major markets due to high inflation and the war in Ukraine.\n\nRegister now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register\n\nThe predictions reinforce the urgency for Foxconn to reduce its reliance on smartphones and consumer electronics, which make up slightly more than half of its total revenue, and diversify into areas such as electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing which it sees as a $34 billion business by 2025.\n\n"There are many uncertainties in the market at the moment," Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way told a post-earnings call, citing the pandemic, geopolitical risks and inflation among them for the year.\n\n"They are presenting quite some challenges to demand and supply," Liu said.\n\nThe slight decline estimated in consumer electronics revenue for the second quarter was due to a higher base last year and before new product launches later this year, he said.\n\nLiu said inflation is hitting demand for lower-end consumer electronics but the impact on the company so far has been limited as most of its products are higher end.\n\n"We are closely watching when inflation will impact mid and high end products," he said.\n\nThe company, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, expects overall revenue to be flat for the current quarter and for the full year. It did not provide a numerical outlook, but projected strong growth for its other businesses such as components, computing products and cloud and networking products.\n\nIn the first quarter ended in March, Foxconn\'s revenue rose 4%. Net profit grew 5% to T$29.45 billion ($985.48 million) and was largely in line with an average analyst estimate of T$29.76 billion, according to Refinitiv.\n\nIn autos, Foxconn said it will develop new vehicles with struggling U.S. EV maker Lordstown Motors Corp (RIDE.O). On Wednesday, the Taiwan company said it completed a deal to buy a factory in Ohio from Lordstown for $230 million.\n\nThe two companies will also form a joint venture to make vehicles, with Lordstown owning a 45% stake and Foxconn owning the rest. read more\n\nLiu said gross profit margins for assembling EVs are relatively low, similar to its smartphone assembly business. That is why Foxconn plans to develop more profitable EV components such as auto chips and batteries, he said.\n\n"Only in this way can we achieve double-digit gross profit margins."\n\nFoxconn shares closed 1% lower ahead of the earnings release, versus a 2.4% drop in the broader market (.TWII).

"Meanwhile, some countries in Southeast Asia have transitioned from recovery to production expansion, replacing Chinese exports to some extent."\n\nJulian Evans-Pritchard, senior China economist at Capital Economics, said the main headwind to exports is weakening foreign demand.\n\n"The sharpest falls were in shipments to the EU and U.S., where high inflation is weighing on real household incomes," he said. "The declines were also especially pronounced in electronics exports which suggest a further unwinding of pandemic-linked demand for Chinese goods."\n\nECONOMY UNDER LOCKDOWN\n\nBeijing\'s extraordinary efforts to curb the country\'s largest COVID-19 outbreaks in two years have clogged highways and ports, restricted activity in dozens of cities including Shanghai and forced companies from Apple supplier Foxconn to automakers Toyota and Volkswagen to suspend some operations. read more\n\nFactory activity was already contracting at a sharper pace in April, industry surveys showed, raising fears of a steep slowdown that could also hit global growth. read more\n\nContainers are seen at the Yangshan Deep Water Port in Shanghai, China August 6, 2019.

"Life is already hard enough and it happens we\'ve got a leaky roof as it rains."\n\nAdditionally, heightened risks from the Ukraine war, persistently soft consumption and a prolonged downturn in the property market are also weighing on growth, analysts say.\n\nWith the national jobless rate at a near two-year high, authorities have promised more help to shore up confidence and ward off further job losses in a politically sensitive year.\n\nSome analysts even warn of rising recession risks, saying policymakers must provide more stimulus to reach an official 2022 growth target of about 5.5% if Beijing doesn\'t ease its zero-COVID policy.\n\nHowever, there are few signs of that happening. The country\'s top leaders said last week they would stick with their "zero-COVID" policy, stoking worries of a sharper economic downturn. read more\n\nExports may have found some support from a weaker yuan , which suffered its worst month in April in nearly two years.\n\nZhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management, does not expect export growth to perk up in May as supply problems persist.\n\n"The contraction of imports is a signal, as many firms’ imports of parts of components probably got disrupted," Zhang said in a note.
