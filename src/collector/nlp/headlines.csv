Joe Biden wants to show hes in charge of inflation  while showing someone else is in charge,2022-05-31 00:00:00,"This story is part of CNN Business' Nightcap newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here. https://www.cnn.com/specials/nightcap

New York (CNN Business) President Joe Biden will meet with Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell Tuesday in a kind of performative politics that will almost certainly do nothing to help Americans better afford everyday items .

And, let's be honest, it'll probably do nothing for Biden's poll numbers , either, because Biden's desired outcomes from the the meeting are contradictory:

That's the dilemma Biden faced in his Wall Street Journal op-ed Monday, in which he outlined his three-part plan for tackling inflation (we added somebelow for emphasis):

""That is why I have made tackling inflation my top economic priority. My plan has three parts: First, the Federal Reserve has a primary responsibility to control inflation. My predecessor demeaned the Fed, and past presidents have sought to influence its decisions inappropriately during periods of elevated inflation. I won't do this.""

Biden acknowledged he does have some sway over the Fed, by appointing ""highly qualified people from both parties to lead that institution."" But you usually don't start your plan by saying, ""This is my biggest priority"" immediately followed by ""Which is why I'm letting those guys over there to handle it.""

To be fair to Biden, his predecessors have met with Fed chairs, too. And there really is very little any president alone can do to rein in inflation. Supply chain issues, a war in Europe , China's lockdowns and a labor shortage are beyond the capabilities of one pen stroke to fix.

And the Fed certainly has made life difficult for Biden. Economists largely agree the Fed was woefully late to take action on inflation, unhelpfully calling it ""transitory"" until a just few months ago (duh!) and raising rates only after inflation hit a four-decade high

Now, at last, the Fed is taking drastic action to curtail inflation. Economists (and investors -- OMG, have you seen the stock market lately?) worry that the Fed might be too late, and a double-dose of pain meds might send the economy crashing into a recession.

Of course, outside factors and the Fed don't deserve all the blame. Biden did help juice inflation with a round of stimulus checks in March 2021. Most of that money is now coming off the books, lowering the deficit in the process, a fact Biden loves to mention (it was point No. 3 in the Journal op-ed). But it's not like he woke up one day and suddenly became a deficit hawk: Biden was pushing for a $3.5 trillion economic plan and more Covid relief not so long ago.

A pointless meeting

This may be the most pointless White House meeting since Kanye West met with former President Donald Trump to pitch a hydrogen-powered Air Force One jet. It's somehow both extraordinary -- and extraordinarily silly.

There's a good reason the president doesn't often meet with the Fed chair: The Fed is supposed to be nonpartisan and apolitical, acting in the best interests of all Americans and the economy as a whole. Its noninterference gives the market stability and sends a message that data, not politics, are in charge. The president gets to appoint people to the Fed, but then gets to quietly grumble about them like the rest of us.

So there's something inherently wrong with the president -- not just this one -- meeting with the Fed chair. And yet presidents keep doing it anyway. Although they're still relatively rare, presidents have called Fed chairs to the Oval Office in each of recent past administrations: Trump met with Powell in 2019. Former President Barack Obama met with then-Chair Janet Yellen in 2016 and her predecessor Ben Bernanke in 2011. Former President George W. Bush met with former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan on several occasions.

Trump, of course, broke with that ""hands-off"" tradition by incessantly tweeting at Powell about lowering interest rates (which Powell ultimately did when the Covid pandemic hit and kept them there when the economy got hot again -- which is what economists say got us into this inflation mess, so....)

Biden is decidedly not doing that. But he's still making the same mistake presidents of the past have made by calling Powell to the White House: He's trying to have it both ways, and it's unclear who the audience is for this meeting. Biden will now get to say he met with Powell when discussing inflation (cool, we guess), but he'll also get to remind America that the Fed is handling the situation.

Meanwhile, gas still costs $5 a gallon, and none of this really makes us feel much better.

The stock market casino is closed,2022-05-31 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business)Investors have learned a bunch of hard lessons so far in 2022. The stock market doesn't always go up. And factors such as the economy, earnings and valuations, which might sound like quaint relics of a bygone era, still matter even in a world seemingly dominated by memes and Reddit boards.
Picking winning stocks isn't easy, especially at a time when the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates and inflation is starting to hurt consumers and the broader economy. Shares of many speculative tech companies are now tumbling due to worries about weakening fundamentals and unsustainable stock prices. 
But this isn't necessarily the worst news for the markets. Investors just need to once again do more homework to find good bargains. 
""The casino is closed,"" said Peter Mallouk, president and CEO of Creative Planning, a wealth management firm. 
""The days of stimulus are over. This is now more of a thinking person's market. Total speculation is dead,"" Mallouk said, adding that traders can no longer pass around blank check SPAC stocks, cryptocurrencies, unprofitable tech firms and other risky investments like hot potatoes and hope someone else will want to catch them.
Stock picking seemed a lot easier when the Fed was doing everything in its power to try to stimulate the economy. Many investors do not have experience navigating the market when the central bank is jacking up rates in a bid to cool things down.
""The world is waking up to the fact that zero percent interest rates are done,"" said Max Wasserman, co-founder of Miramar Capital. ""Rates were real low and people took on excess risk because anytime the stock market pulled back, the Fed cut rates. The message was to buy the dips because the Fed has your back. But the party's over.""
Forget the memes and focus on fundamentals
Some investors who were flush with Covid stimulus cash last year and chased meme stocks like GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC) may now be less bullish on individual stocks.
""The excitement of stock-picking and the active investing strategies approach reached new levels of popularity during the meme stock trading phenomenon in early 2021,"" Lindsey Bell, chief markets and money strategist for Ally, said in a report late last week. ""Now, stock market losses have made some investors sour on the strategy."" 
But Bell noted that investors who do their homework can still ""make smart investing decisions"" as long as they maintain ""a very hands-on style of investing"" and don't panic. 
""When stocks are declining, a bear market is near and volatility is high, second-guessing investments is normal,"" she wrote. 
Wasserman said that stock picking isn't dead per se. It's just that now is a time for investors to look for quality companies that can perform well even as interest rates go up and the economy potentially slows as a result. 
That means doing more than just buying the tech-heavy S&P 500, which is dominated by the likes of big Nasdaq leaders Apple (AAPL), Tesla (TSLA), Google owner Alphabet (GOOGL) and Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB).
""You can't just keep throwing money in the air and expect everything to go up. When you buy an ETF, you're just buying a basket of stocks and everyone is buying that same basket"" Wasserman said. ""We're not chasing the same things everyone else is chasing. There is more volatility to come and we hope to take advantage of that.""
Wasserman specifically recommends blue chip stocks that pay steady dividends and thinks investors should have their portfolios diversified throughout a variety of sectors. 
With that in mind, he owns stocks ranging from brand name giants UPS (UPS), Coca-Cola (KO) and Pepsi (PEP) to dividend-paying techs such as Corning (GLW), Microsoft (MSFT) and Texas Instruments (TXN). Wasserman said Timberland, The North Face and Vans owner VF Corp. (VFC), medical devices leader Medtronic (MDT) and gold miner Newmont (NEM) are also solid values.
The good news — if you want to call it that — is that the current market turbulence doesn't mean that a long bear market necessarily lies ahead.
""This could be bumpy, but not a crash. This whole turmoil may last less than a year and it's already underway,"" Mallouk said. ""This is not like 2000 or 2009. This is a normal bear market.""
""The best place to build long-term wealth is still the stock market,"" Mallouk added. ""You may just have to hold your nose if you buy today.""

Home prices rose by more than 20 yearoveryear in March,2022-05-31 00:00:00," (CNN)US home prices continued to surge higher in March, as buyers raced to lock in homes before the average mortgage rate hit 5%. 
Home prices rose 20.6% in March from the year before, an even higher rate than the 20% growth seen in February, according to the S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller US National Home Price Index. It was the highest year-over-year price change in more than 35 years of data. 
Sun Belt cities again saw the biggest price increases among the 20 US cities tracked by the index. But for the first time in nearly three years, the city with the most rapid growth in housing prices was not Phoenix.
Prices in Tampa, Florida, were up the most, rising 34.8% from the year before; Phoenix was up 32.4% from a year ago and Miami saw a 32% increase. Seventeen of the 20 cities reported higher price increases in the year ending March 2022 versus the year ending February 2022.
Prices were strongest in the South and Southeast, but every region continued to show big gains.
With mortgage rates rising and the Federal Reserve ratcheting up interest rates, the anticipated deceleration in the housing market did not arrive in March, said Craig J. Lazzara, managing director at S&P Dow Jones Indices.
""The macroeconomic environment may not support extraordinary home price growth for much longer,"" said Lazzara. ""Although one can safely predict that price gains will begin to decelerate, the timing of the deceleration is a more difficult call."" 
Another steep rise in home prices in March indicates that buyers felt pressure to bid competitively on the few homes available for sale, said Danielle Hale, chief economist for Realtor.com.
""Home shoppers were motivated to lock in a mortgage rate before price increases, rising rates, or a combination of the two delivered a knockout punch to their aspirations,"" Hale said.

A lot has happened since March, however. While mortgage rates surged nearly a whole percentage point in March, average rates for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage did not reach 5% until April. Since then, rates have risen to as high as 5.3%, but have retreated over the past few weeks, according to Freddie Mac. In addition, the Fed has raised its benchmark interest rate twice -- including the largest rate hike since 2000 -- and the double whammy of inflation and the war in Ukraine has taken a greater toll on the economy. 
More recent housing data suggest the market has shifted since March.
""We've observed a real estate refresh that has more sellers listing homes, leading to greater availability of homes for sale compared to this time last year,"" said Hale. ""Meanwhile, mortgage rates have steadied, but remain near the highest levels in 13 years.""
But importantly, she said, recent sales data for both new homes and existing homes signal that buyers are increasingly unable or unwilling to buy a home under these conditions.
""As buyer confidence sags and weighs down demand, real estate markets will re-balance, eventually tilting away from the heavy advantage that recent home sellers have enjoyed,"" said Hale. ""This will initially mean fewer home sales, which should diminish the bidding wars and concessions that buyers make to sweeten offers.""

Investors who've relied on a standard 60/40 portfolio this year have taken a bath as stocks and bonds have tumbled. Crypto traders aren't faring well, either. Even gold, the go-to safe haven in volatile times, is underperforming.

But for a small subset of specialized hedge funds known as quants, the chaos of 2022 has unleashed a windfall.

While the S&P 500 is down more than 13% this year, quant hedge funds — which rely on complex mathematical models to make investing decisions — are up more than 15%, according to HFR, a hedge fund research group.

""Macro hedge funds experienced a historic quarter,"" says Kenneth J. Heinz, HFR's president. ""Since the beginning of the year, macro strategies — in particular macro strategies that are quantitative, trend-following or commodity-oriented — have produced extremely strong performance.""

That may seem odd to casual market observers. After all, the hedge funds making headlines lately are most notable for their losses. Melvin Capital, once one of Wall Street's most successful hedge funds, announced earlier this month that it is shutting down. New York-based Tiger Global has reportedly lost $17 billion in this year's tech selloff.

""If you owned growth stocks this year — like we did at Altimeter — you got your face ripped off,"" tweeted Brad Gerstner, CEO of tech-focused Altimeter Capital, earlier this month.

But quants are unique sub-species of hedge fund. Essentially, their highly secretive mathematical models are taking in the price of liquid assets, mostly futures contracts, and forecasting based on trends which way the market is likely to swing.

There's no emotional, fallible human at the wheel the way there would be with most other managed funds.

Quants are ""by definition unemotional,"" Heinz tells me. These funds make up just 17% of the industry, but institutional investors are increasingly taking note.

In the first quarter of this year, institutional investors allocated the largest amount of new capital to hedge funds since 2015, according to HFR. Quants are leading the industry through ""extreme volatility"" — inflation at four-decade highs, tightening monetary policy, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including surging commodity prices.

So, why doesn't everyone just follow the quant strategy?

This upswing for computer-driven funds is relatively new, and has come as a result of a breakdown of historical correlation between equities and bonds. But Heinz says he expects to see more money investors allocating capital with macro-focused funds. Strong performance attracts capital, and ""we've obviously seen a good example of the type performance that institutions are interested in,"" he says.

Europe blocks Russian oil

European Union leaders agreed to ban virtually all oil imports from Russia by the end of this year, a historic deal to try to choke Moscow's revenue as it continues its assault on Ukraine.

""This immediately covers more than 2/3 of oil imports from Russia, cutting a huge source of financing for its war machine,"" European Council chief Charles Michel tweeted Monday evening.

It's a massive accomplishment, to be sure, my colleague Luke McGee writes. Getting 27 countries to agree on a package that will almost certainly damage their own economies on the behalf of Ukraine, a country that isn't even in the EU, was unthinkable even a few months ago.

The deal, however, isn't flawless. The ban contains an exemption for oil delivered from Russia via pipelines, accounting for a third of Russian imports to Europe.

""It's a fair compromise ... this was the best we could get,"" Estonian Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said, according to Reuters.

Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that the pipeline issue would be discussed again, but she didn't offer a timeframe.

Futures for Brent crude rose 1.8% to $119 a barrel on Tuesday.

Meanwhile, Russia is having little trouble finding buyers in Asia. As my CNN Business colleague Diksha Madhok writes, India's appetite for cheap Russian oil is only growing , and Russian crude flows to that country this month are roughly nine times higher than the 2021 monthly average.

Summer travel headaches

The start of the summer travel season has kicked off with a lot of frustration . Don't expect it to get better soon.

Around 6,000 global flights were canceled between Friday and Monday, with hundreds more delayed, according to flight tracking website FlightAware. Some 1,640 flights were canceled on Sunday alone.

Delta Air Lines, which had the most cancellations among American carriers this weekend, blamed Saturday's disruptions on bad weather and ""air traffic control actions"" that took place on Friday, saying it is trying to preemptively cancel flights at least 24 hours in advance.

""More than any time in our history, the various factors currently impacting our operation — weather and air traffic control, vendor staffing, increased Covid case rates contributing to higher-than-planned unscheduled absences in some work groups — are resulting in an operation that isn't consistently up to the standards Delta has set for the industry in recent years,"" a spokesperson for the airline wrote.

Big picture: We're entering our third Covid summer, but the hangover of 2020 is still with us. Demand is soaring, but airlines are struggling to staff up. Pilots are in especially short supply after the pandemic prompted many to retire and slowed training and recruitment.

Passenger traffic at US airports is approaching pre-pandemic levels, but staffing on the ground hasn't rebounded at the same clip. That means that when summer storms hit, as they did over Memorial Day weekend, there's little slack in the system to cope with cancellations and delays.

All of that, combined with higher jet fuel prices, are leaving passengers with sticker shock and an understandable outrage over having their travel plans torpedoed. But with no quick fix, there's little consumers can do other than buckle up and pray for good weather. (And, perhaps, consider a road trip as a back-up plan.)","['Allison Morrow', 'Cnn Business']",CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/investing/premarket-stocks-trading/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220531071934-new-york-stock-exchange-052722-super-tease.jpg
Consumers are feeling less confident about the economy but theyre still spending,2022-05-31 00:00:00,"San Francisco (CNN Business) Inflation may be showing signs that it's easing, but the high-cost environment still has American consumers wary about the direction of the economy.

The Conference Board's consumer confidence index dipped slightly to 106.4 in May, down from a revised 108.6 in April, according to data released Tuesday. The decline was smaller than the 103.9 analysts expected, according to Refinitiv.

""Inflation remains top of mind for consumers, with their inflation expectations in May virtually unchanged from April's elevated levels,"" said Lynn Franco, senior director of economic indicators at The Conference Board. ""Looking ahead, expect surging prices and additional interest rate hikes to pose continued downside risks to consumer spending this year.""

For most Americans, the three biggest expenses are housing, transportation and food -- all of which have seen significant price increases over the past year.

April's core Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation index, which doesn't include the volatile food and energy prices, rose by 4.9% year-over-year , down from a 5.2% increase in March, the Commerce Department reported Friday.","['Alicia Wallace', 'Cnn Business']",CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/economy/consumer-confidence-may-2022/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220530163640-01-consumer-confidence-0518-restricted-super-tease.jpg
Stores have too much stuff That means discounts are coming,2022-05-27 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business)Some welcome news for shoppers getting squeezed by inflation: promotions on televisions, furniture, clothing, sporting goods and other big-ticket purchases are ramping up.
Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), Best Buy (BBY), Urban Outfitters (URBN) and other top retailers have said in recent weeks that they are sitting on too much inventory for some of their products. As a result, they plan to mark down prices and step up sales on those items to clear the glut.
It marks a major reversal from much of 2021, when discounts on big-ticket items were scarce for consumers.
Last year, big chains dialed back on promotions because products were in tight supply due to production bottlenecks and slowdowns at key global ports. 
Stores and brands were able to sell merchandise at full price to consumers who had built up savings while staying home during the pandemic and were eager to spend big on their homes and wardrobes.

Conditions have changed in recent months. Some stores are sitting on an excess inventory of goods they ordered from manufacturers months ago with the expectation that consumer spending would be red hot. But demand has softened as consumers feel the pressure from the highest annual jump in inflation since the 1980s.
""Companies chased as much merchandise as possible to support demand, which has now slowed,"" Dana Telsey, CEO and chief research officer at Telsey Advisory Group, said in a note to clients Monday. Markdowns and promotions are starting to pick up, she said.
""There is a surplus of inventory ... across the board at retail right now,"" Urban Outfitters' CEO Richard Hayne said Tuesday.
Urban Outfitters will increase promotions for the remainder of the year and into the winter holiday shopping season, he said.
Target said it was carrying too many big, bulky products such as furniture, televisions and kitchen appliances last quarter and misjudged how extensive the consumer shift to luggage, toy and home decor purchases would be.
""We didn't anticipate the magnitude of that shift,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell said last week.
Target has been marking down some of those bigger items to make room for products that are in higher demand. 
And Best Buy said it, too, has seen an increase in promotions for TVs and computers.
""Some products were even more promotional than we expected coming into the quarter and were similar to pre-pandemic levels,"" CEO Corie Barry said Tuesday. Barry added, however, that Best Buy's ""inventory remains healthy"" and is in line with the company's sales growth during the pandemic.
Shoppers may also be able to find more bargains at closeout retailers such as TJX  (TJX)and Burlington (BURL), which capitalize on an inventory glut.
These companies buy up high-end goods for cheap and then turn around and sell them to shoppers at a discount from their original prices.
""The buying environment now is better than it has been for years,"" Burlington CEO Michael O'Sullivan said Thursday. ""We're seeing brands that we haven't seen for a couple of years.""

India shows no sign of slowing its purchase of Russian oil,2022-05-31 00:00:00,"New Delhi (CNN Business)India's appetite for cheap Russian oil is swelling, even as the West continues to hit Moscow with unprecedented sanctions. 
Russian Crude flows to India are expected to reach 3.36 million metric tonnes in May, according to estimates from Refinitiv. This is nearly 9 times higher than the 2021 monthly average of 382,500 metric tonnes.
Overall, the country has received 4.8 million metric tonnes of discounted Russian oil since the Ukraine war started, Refinitiv added. Urals oil from Russia currently trades at about $95 a barrel, while the global benchmark Brent crude is above $119 a barrel. 
Part of the reason for the price disparity: The West has shunned Russian oil. On Monday, the EU agreed to ban 90% of Russian oil imports by the end of the year. Europe is the biggest buyer of Russian energy. 
The United States, Canada, United Kingdom and Australia have already banned imports.
The embargo from a huge importer like Europe would pile pressure on the Russian economy, but Moscow has found other buyers in Asia.
India, which imports 80% of its oil, usually buys only about 2% to 3% from Russia. But with oil prices shooting up this year, the government has steadily increased its intake from Moscow, taking advantage of the heavy discounts. 
According to Refinitiv, Russia crude flows to India soared to 1.01 million metric tonnes in April from 430,000 metric tonnes in March. 
India's Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas did not immediately respond to a query on the impact EU's partial ban will have on the South Asian economy's oil ties with Moscow.  
Earlier in May, India played down the import spike. In a statement, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas said the country imports oil from all over the world, including a significant volume from the United States. 
""Despite attempts to portray it otherwise, energy purchases from Russia remain minuscule in comparison to India's total consumption,"" the ministry said in a statement. ""India's legitimate energy transactions cannot be politicized,"" it added.
The world's biggest democracy has refrained from taking a tough stance against Moscow over the war in Ukraine. Russia and India have a long history of friendly relations, which stretch back to the Soviet era when the USSR helped India win its 1971 war with Pakistan. 
India isn't the only Asian giant buying Russian oil. China, historically the single biggest buyer of Russian oil, is expected to go on a shopping spree, too.
OilX, which uses industry and satellite data to track oil production and flows, found that China's imports from Russia by pipeline and sea rose by 175,000 barrels per day in April — an increase of about 11% over average volumes in 2021. Seaborne imports are rising more sharply in May, according to early data. 
Demand is expected to pick up as the world's second largest economy begins loosening its strict Covid-related restrictions in major cities. 
EU moves ahead with partial ban
While Asia's purchase of Russian crude is surging, the EU on Monday resolved to block most of it by the end of this year.
Russian crude accounted for 27% of the bloc's imports in 2021, according to Eurostat. 
Russian oil delivered by tankers would be banned, while an exemption will be made for the southern segment of the Druzhba pipeline, said Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, in a press conference. 
The northern segment of the pipeline serves Poland and Germany — who have agreed to the embargo. The southern part goes to Hungary, Slovakia and Czech republic and accounts for 10% of imports of Russian oil.
After the embargo, Moscow may look for new customers more aggressively, but it won't be easy.
A significant portion of Russia's oil exports to Europe travel to the bloc via pipelines. Rerouting those barrels to markets in Asia would require costly new infrastructure that would take years to build.

The Great Reshuffling played a big part in pushing home prices higher,2022-05-30 00:00:00," (CNN)The pandemic changed the way people lived and, for many, where they lived. Working from home was a significant driver of this ""Great Reshuffling"" and accounted for more than half of the steep increases in home prices seen during the pandemic, new research has found.
Remote work allowed some people to move to places farther away from their office and prompted others to buy larger homes to accommodate their new lifestyles. The demand for more house and the ability to move to warmer climates played a sizable role in pushing home prices higher, according to a new National Bureau of Economic Research working paper by researchers from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and the University of California, San Diego.
Home prices grew by 23.8% during the pandemic, according to the researchers' population-weighted analysis of Zillow's home price index between December 2019 and November 2021. And the study found that remote work accounted for 15.1% of that growth.
The findings suggest there was more than just speculation behind the turbo-charged growth in home prices during the pandemic, said Johannes Wieland, an associate professor of economics at the University of California, San Diego, and co-author of the study. He added that the evolution of remote work is likely to have a large impact on the future path of home prices and inflation.
""We were pretty shocked remote work had this impact, once we saw the estimates,"" Wieland said. ""We thought about how people moving to different locations would be important. And it is. But it is the people who are remaining in a metro area -- the people who need more space at home if they work at home -- that is really pushing up prices. That is the majority of the story.""
The findings support what economists at Zillow have been seeing throughout the pandemic. 
""We've seen what we called the 'Great Reshuffling' that has contributed to the demand for housing nationwide,"" said Chris Glynn, senior managing economist at Zillow. ""It has accelerated trends that existed before the pandemic. Migration to places like Austin [Texas] and Raleigh [North Carolina] has been happening for a while, but the pandemic accelerated it because of the un-tethering between an office and home that has allowed people to make choices about where they want to live.""
What makes a hot remote work spot 
The Sun Belt attracted remote workers looking for a warm weather lifestyle even before the pandemic. But the researchers found that the trend gained further momentum during the pandemic, pushing up home prices in those areas at a much faster rate than before the pandemic. 
By the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, the median single-family, existing-home price in Austin had  grown by 26% from the year before, according to the National Association of Realtors. Prices in Phoenix were also up by 26% and in Boise, Idaho, by 24.3%.
The researchers found that cities that already had a large share of remote workers before the pandemic tended to attract even more after the pandemic shutdowns pushed a whole wave of people to work remotely.
""Where more people are working remotely, that's where the home prices grow,"" said Wieland, who noted that cities like Austin, Boise, Phoenix and San Diego saw some of the biggest home prices increases in the country as a result.
These remote-work-friendly cities share three main features, he said. The first is a predominant industry that allows for remote work. Tech jobs, for example, are easily done remotely because they mostly involve work on a computer, he noted.
The second aspect is a lower population density, where there is more space and more affordable housing than in the biggest cities in the country.
""It is hard to work at home in New York City, for example,"" he said, explaining the cost of living there means that having extra space for an office comes at a premium. ""Lower-density areas are more attractive for remote work.""
The third feature is a warmer climate or appealing lifestyle. ""There is more remote work where the weather is nice,"" he said. ""When you're not tied to a location because of your job, you can choose where you want to be. Many of these places...are attractive to people who can move to a place for lifestyle and not for work.""
That is why many of the cities in the Sun Belt saw such huge increases in home prices during the pandemic, he explained.
A fast impact on home prices
The pandemic spurred us to change the way we work very quickly, said Wieland. 
""There hasn't been a peacetime period where we have changed the way we do work in such a quick fashion,"" he said. ""Suddenly, we are moving further away from where our work is located. We don't need the office space. We now need this home space for work.""
In a perfect world, you'd want to see the economy adapt to this change in preferences and opportunities, he said. ""But it is hard to do with housing in a year or two, especially at a time when supply is not very high to begin with,"" he said. ""That is one of the reasons why home prices are going up at such a rapid rate.""
In their research, Wieland and his co-author John A. Mondragon, an economic research adviser at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, looked at a housing market impacted by many variables, including the low supply of homes for sale, a demographic bulge of Millennials reaching typical home buying age and the Fed's slashing of interest rates during the pandemic, which resulted in ultra-low mortgage rates for more than a year.
The researchers measured the amount home prices in an area went up as it related to the amount of remote workers living in the area.

This is not the retirement I envisioned How retirees are getting hit by inflation,2022-05-27 00:00:00,"Managing one's finances in retirement is always tricky. But with inflation pushing up the price of everything from gas to housing to eggs, many retirees are cutting back or eliminating certain costs altogether.

CNN Business spoke with several retirees about how they have been managing their spending as prices have risen. One common refrain was the shock of dealing with the huge jump in food prices -- especially on meat, fruits and vegetables.

Food prices have seen their largest annual increase in 41 years . And the cost of groceries jumped 10.8% between April 2021 and April 2022.

But of course, inflation's reach goes far beyond the supermarket. Here's how these retirees say they are coping.

Scraping by and facing a rent hike

If it weren't for a local food bank truck that comes to her apartment building every two weeks, retiree Donna Lyons of Fort Collins, Colorado, said she might not have sufficient food for the month.

""I'm very, very reliant on [the food bank]. ... It is a true blessing,"" said Lyons, 67, who moved to Colorado from Pennsylvania in 2020 to be closer to her two children and grandchildren.

She gets by for now on her Social Security checks and the pension she receives for decades of work in secretarial and event-security roles in Pennsylvania's education system.

But come September, her rent will be increased by $200 a month -- a 14% jump over what she pays now. And Lyons estimates that at that point, after paying for rent, taxes, insurance, medications and utilities, she'll only have $150 a month left over to pay for groceries and incidentals.

Given that her most recent monthly grocery bill alone was $187, she's not sure how she'll be able to stay in her apartment, since her savings are almost depleted. She's been looking for less expensive housing in the area, she said, but hasn't had any luck so far.

""I've thought about selling everything and going back to Pennsylvania, but I don't want to leave my family,"" Lyons said, adding that she'd been in the hospital recently and doesn't know what she would have done without her kids' help during that time.

Her expectations for retirement were very different than her present reality. ""I didn't expect the level of stress financially. I truly didn't. I worked for 50 years. And I was a single parent, so savings weren't exactly easy. I'm slowly eating through them just to survive.""

Cutting back, resuming part-time work

Retired teacher Marisa Flynn, 73, lives in a resident-owned mobile home park in Morgan Hill, California, in the southern part of Silicon Valley. She had run her own electrolysis business for years before starting a second career as a public school teacher. She receives both a pension and half of her ex-husband's Social Security.

Flynn had thought she'd be okay financially in retirement but hadn't realized her Social Security payments would be reduced by about $400 a month because of her teacher's pension. And every time she gets a cost-of-living adjustment to her Social Security benefits a bigger chunk is deducted for Medicare , she said.

That wasn't easy to manage before the pandemic and then inflation hit. But now she is feeling the strain like never before.

Her utility and gas costs have jumped significantly in the past year.

US gas prices recently reached an average of $4.60 a gallon, the highest on record . For April, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that energy prices, which include electricity and natural gas commonly used for heating and cooling homes, was up 30.3% year-over-year.

As a result, Flynn said she uses less heat and air conditioning. She also drives less, even to see her daughter and grandchildren who live 40 minutes away. ""Before, I would just get in my car and not think about it.""

Getting her car washed for $20 is also out of the question -- and it's hard to do it herself because of California's water use restrictions. She doesn't eat out, has no internet and can't afford the repairs her home needs, she said.

To help make ends meet, Flynn is substitute teaching two half-days a week, something she had done before the pandemic, but has now resumed even though it poses an increased health risk to her due to Covid.

She said she also receives Meals on Wheels and will occasionally go to a local senior center for a free lunch.

""This is not the retirement I envisioned. It is disheartening. The government always talks about helping families with children. Middle class elders feel forgotten and invisible,"" Flynn said.

Like Lyons, Flynn has considered moving to a less expensive area, but she isn't likely to do it because it would mean being farther from her daughter and grandchildren. ""That would be sad for me.""

Watching their financial cushion shrink

Not all retirees, of course, are struggling financially as a result of inflation, but it is nevertheless altering their behavior.

Richard and Peggy Thomas have seen the padding in their financial cushion start to thin because of higher prices.

Arkansas City, Kansas, resident Richard Thomas, 73, prepared carefully for retirement during his career as a mechanic fabricating composite jet engine parts at Boeing. That preparation paid off, despite his getting a smaller-than-expected pension after the plant where he worked was bought out in 2005 and he was forced to retire earlier than he had anticipated.

Thomas said he owns his home outright and doesn't carry credit card debt. ""After my home was paid off I put a lot into savings and my 401(k). When I retired, I was in a fairly good place financially. It's remarkable how far your money goes when you don't owe anyone money,"" he said.

Between their Social Security checks, his pension and an annuity they purchased, Thomas said he and his wife, Peggy, can cover all their monthly expenses with some left over. But that surplus is shrinking.

Thanks to inflation, ""the padding in the financial 'cushion' I worked so hard to build up is starting to thin,"" Thomas said. ""It has forced us to make some changes.""

While the couple was never big on traveling, they now take even fewer trips. They also drive less -- and more slowly -- to conserve gas. That means fewer spontaneous drives to Wichita an hour away or dinners out in a town 30 miles away, he said.

Plans to buy a new car are also tabled. ""The starting price for a new Jeep is $15,000 more than my house cost,"" Thomas joked. (Technically, on an inflation-adjusted basis, the new Jeep still costs less, but not wildly less, than the 1997 purchase price Thomas said he paid for his home.)

While Thomas said he wishes the annual cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security were more in line with the actual price increases he sees, he recognizes the couple's frugality and financial planning are helping him and his wife weather this inflationary chapter more easily than others.

""So far inflation isn't a huge burden, but it is becoming cumbersome,"" Thomas said.

Better off than most, but still cutting back

Jane Tanaka, 60, and her husband, Greg Chick, 67, retired a year ago and are enjoying their free time after working 12-hour days for years as a psychiatrist and plumber, respectively.

The couple, who live in Tehachapi, California, paid off their mortgage earlier in their careers, Tanaka said. And once that was taken care of, they socked away 40% of their incomes for retirement, she added. So they were financially well-prepared.

Jane Tanaka and her husband, Greg Chick, are cooking more and traveling less due to inflation and falling stocks.

But in light of rising prices and the stock market downturn, Tanaka said they are choosing for now to live on $2,000 less per month than they had planned, drawing income only from her husband's Social Security benefits and their annuities. ""We are not touching our retirement savings because we don't want to sell our investments at a loss.""

Instead they're doing a lot of home cooking, rather than buying prepared foods or eating out. Her husband is taking care of the property around their house. She is mending their clothes. Plans for travel have been curtailed, even for road trips in their RV due to gas prices. And instead of donating money to favorite causes like they used to, they're donating their time instead. ""Now I spend all day baking for a dog rescue club [fundraiser],"" Tanaka said.

She's very aware that the financial choices they're making now are ""first-world-type delayed gratification choices"" as she put it. ""There are far worse problems we could be facing.""

But Tanaka said she hopes her story might encourage young people to save money if they can during their working years to fund their future. ""It's about preparing for a rainy day ... and trying to adapt.""","['Jeanne Sahadi', 'Cnn Business']",CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/success/inflation-retirees-spending/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220520132659-restricted-us-inflation-cost-of-living-super-tease.jpg
A corporate raider is coming after Hellmanns and Dove,2022-05-31 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business)A shakeup may be in the works at Unilever, the consumer goods giant behind brands like Dove soap, Hellmann's mayonnaise and Vaseline.
Unilever (UL) announced Monday that Nelson Peltz, one of the most influential corporate raiders on Wall Street, will join the company's board of directors and disclosed that Peltz's fund holds a 1.5% stake in Unilever.
Peltz is an activist investor known for pushing under-performing companies to restructure, spin-off businesses and even break up. In the past, he has helped force changes at food and consumer giants such as Procter & Gamble (PG), Mondelez (MDLZ) and Wendy's (WEN). 

It's not immediately clear what Peltz has planned for London-based Unilever, which has lagged rivals in recent years and made three failed bids to acquire GlaxoSmithKline's consumer health care business. 
In January, Unilever said it was cutting 1,500 management jobs around the world and simplifying its business structure.
Some analysts have called for Unilever to split its food and drink brands from its home and personal care division.
Wall Street, however, is betting that Peltz will help transform Unilever. Shares rose 8% during early trading Tuesday. Analysts say the company needs a major revamp.
""Unilever has a double problem,"" said AllianceBernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne. The company is in ""structurally low growth categories"" and investors have lost confidence in the board and management.
Monteyne expects Peltz to bring Unilever ""back to basics"" and focus on investing in innovation, adjusting executive compensation incentives and accelerating the pace of acquisitions and sales.
Unilever has been on Peltz's radar for months. In January, the Financial Times reported that he acquired a stake in the company. On Monday, Unilever chair Nils Anderson said in a statement that the company has held ""extensive and constructive discussions"" with Peltz.

'American Idol' winner says he wants to 'stay in the house for a bit'

New York CNN Business —

“Top Gun: Maverick” took off at the box office this weekend — setting a new record in the process.

The sequel to the 1986 blockbuster, which has Tom Cruise reprise his most iconic role as Pete “Maverick” Mitchell, made an estimated $156 million domestically for its four-day opening weekend, according to Paramount (PGRE).

That gives the film the record for biggest opening over the Memorial Day holiday weekend, overtaking “Pirates of the Caribbean: At World’s End,” which made $153 million in 2007.

“Maverick” surpassed expectations at the ticket booth this weekend. Analysts forecast the film to make closer to $80 million for its weekend opening and $150 million over the four day holiday. It’s easily Cruise’s biggest debut at the box office over his 40-year career and marks the star’s first $100 million opening.

On top of all of that, “Maverick” is the third-biggest debut of the year behind two superhero films, Marvel’s “Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness” and Warner Bros.’ “The Batman.”

Studios and theaters couldn’t ask for a better way to dive into the summer — the film industry’s most lucrative season.

Recently, Paramount has struggled to find its footing in an ever-evolving Hollywood.

That’s not the case in 2022.

Films such as “Scream,” “The Lost City” and “Sonic the Hedgehog 2” have helped give a boost to Paramount and “Maverick” continues that trend.

As for theaters, “Maverick” is another blockbuster helping the industry rebound from two brutal years of the pandemic decimating the business.

“Top Gun: Maverick,” which garnered a stellar 96% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes, now has a clear runway to rack up even more success at the box office. There’s not another major film on the docket until Universal’s “Jurassic World: Dominion,” which opens June 9.",['Frank Pallotta'],CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/31/media/top-gun-maverick-box-office-record/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220526151907-01-top-gun.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill"

'We need a way out': Former Russian colonel criticizes war efforts in Ukraine

The latest on Russia's economy as Putin tries to deal with inflation

London CNN Business —

Russia slashed interest rates on Thursday as a resurgent ruble — buoyed by robust oil and gas revenues and government support — takes some pressure off its wobbling economy.

At an extraordinary meeting, the Russian central bank cut interest rates to 11% from 14% and said further reductions could follow. Rates were hiked as high as 20% in the immediate aftermath of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February as the bank tried to prevent Western sanctions triggering a financial crisis.

“Inflationary pressure eases on the back of the ruble exchange rate dynamics as well as the noticeable decline in inflation expectations of households and businesses,” the Russian central bank said in a statement. It said it expected inflation to fall to between 5% and 7% this year, down from around 17.5% this month.

The ruble crashed to a record low of about 135 to the US dollar in the wake of the invasion as the West froze about half of Russia’s $600 billion foreign currency reserves. Hundreds of multinationals have quit the country, and Russia has been banned from buying key Western technology and services.

But Russia’s currency has since rebounded and is the world’s best performer this year, according to Reuters, propped up by capital controls aimed at forcing businesses and investors to buy rubles, and soaring global energy prices. One US dollar now buys about 62 rubles.

Western efforts to curtail Russian energy imports have been slow-moving, and surging oil and gas prices have boosted the Kremlin’s coffers.

“The key point is that high oil and gas revenues are providing policymakers with a lifeline, allowing them to row back emergency economic measures,” William Jackson, chief emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, said in a research note.

“Against that backdrop, a further easing of capital controls and additional rate cuts seem likely,” he added.

Russian President Vladimir Putin spent years leading up to the war trying to build a “fortress economy,” accumulating reserves that could be deployed in the event of an emergency. On Wednesday, he announced a 10% increase in pensions and the minimum wage to help protect Russians from the impact of inflation.

But Russia’s economy is hardly on a solid footing. Capital controls and emergency reserves can last only so long. And new US restrictions mean Russia could soon default on its foreign debt for the first time in more than a century.

Timothy Ash, a senior emerging market strategist at Bluebay Asset Management, said Putin was now having to deploy those emergency buffers, and that the rate cut was part of a public relations campaign.

‘Info war’

“They are in an info war with the west, the ruble’s part of that,” he told CNN Business.

A deep recession is coming this year. The International Monetary Fund expects Russian GDP to contract by 8.5%, as a consequence of the harsh sanctions imposed on Moscow.

Still, those sanctions have yet to strike deep at the heart of Russia’s fossil fuel resources. Moscow is finding it harder to sell its oil and coal, but its biggest energy customer — the European Union — still can’t agree on an oil embargo and an outright ban on Russian natural gas imports isn’t even on the table.

Russia is now trimming forecasts for the decline in its oil production this year. Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said oil output could fall to between 480 million and 500 million tonnes, down about 6.5% on 2021, state news agency RIA reported Thursday. Russia’s economy ministry had previously forecast a drop of about 9.3% this year.

“I think the contraction will be way smaller,” Novak was quoted as telling reporters on a visit to Iran. “There was only one month with contraction of more than 1 million barrels per day, which is not as deep by now. So, I think there will be a recovery in the future,” he added.

While many Western traders and refineries have been shunning Russian oil and coal, India and China have moved in to pick up some of the slack.

China needs Russian coal Moscow needs new customers,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"Hong Kong (CNN Business) China is buying record amounts of cheap Russian coal, even as Western nations slam Moscow with sanctions over the invasion of Ukraine.

In April, not only did the world's second largest economy buy more coal from Russia than ever before, it also eliminated import tariffs on all types of coal, a move analysts say will mainly benefit Russian suppliers.

China's coal imports from Russia nearly doubled between March and April, reaching 4.42 million metric tons, according to trade data from Refinitiv. Russia has overtaken Australia as China's second biggest supplier since last year and now accounts for 19% of its coal imports, up from the 14% share it had in March.

The booming coal trade boosts both sides. Despite bold pledges to tackle the climate crisis , China is now focused on getting its economy out of a slump and needs coal to fuel power stations and make steel for infrastructure projects. Russia desperately needs new customers for its fossil fuels as they are shunned by the West.

China, the world's top buyer of coal, promised in 2020 to go carbon neutral by 2060. But after severe power shortages hit millions of households and businesses late last year, it ramped up its consumption of coal.

domestic output hit a record 4.13 billion metric tons. This year, these numbers are expected to be even higher as President Xi Jinping Coal imports soared 64% in 2021, anddomestic output hit a record 4.13 billion metric tons. This year, these numbers are expected to be even higher as President Xi Jinping prioritizes infrastructure investments to revive the economy.

Last month, China imported a record 1.09 million metric tons of seaborne coking coal from Russia, up 10% on April last year, according to Matthew Boyle, lead dry bulk analyst at data firm Kpler. Coking coal is used to make steel.

First, there was a dip

Coal trade between China and Russia declined shortly after Moscow invaded Ukraine in February and Western countries started hitting Russia with unprecedented sanctions. Chinese banks were initially reluctant to provide financing for purchases of Russian commodities, according to Reuters.

""After Russia started the assault, Chinese and many other buyers initially scaled back purchases to assess the risk of secondary sanctions,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air, a Helsinki-based think tank.

Russia is the world's third largest coal exporter and now China's second biggest supplier behind Indonesia.

By March, that reluctance had evaporated.

""When it became clear that the EU wasn't moving fast to ban imports, and that effectively prevented both the US and the EU from imposing broader sanctions that would affect other buyers, there was a jump in purchases resulting from latent demand,"" Myllyvirta said.

The European Union has since approved a ban on Russian coal , which is set to take full effect from August. Earlier this month, it also proposed to ban all Russian oil imports within six months.

Getting it cheap

China is not only buying a lot of Russian coal now — it is also buying it at a big discount.

Russia is the world's third largest coal exporter and global prices of the commodity have surged since it invaded Ukraine. The price of ICE Newcastle coal futures have risen more than 40% since the start of March.

""In recent months, sanctions have created a stark bifurcation of the global seaborne coal market, as many importers are now unable or unwilling to import coal from Russia,"" said Toby Hassall, lead analyst for Coal Market Research at London Stock Exchange Group.

As the pool of buyers gets smaller, those importers who are able and willing to buy coal from Russia are ""paying much lower prices for this supply compared with coal sourced from other origins,"" Hassall said.

In April, premium Russian coking coal delivered to Jingtang port in northern China was priced at 2,710 yuan ($403) per metric ton, according to Chinese industry data provider MySteel. That compared with $475 for US coking coal reaching the port, and $423 for coal mined in China.

The price discounts have persisted this month.

By late last week, Russian coking coal at northern China ports averaged about $439 per metric ton, according to Hangzhou-based data provider Hithink Flush Information. Australian coal cost $512, and Chinese coal $496.

To Beijing, buying more from Russia is not only a friendly gesture to Moscow, but also a smart move that benefits China's own economic needs.

""So far, the government seems to be walking a line of maintaining friendly relationships with Russia without encouraging or directing Chinese firms to increase business with the country, and discouraging anything that might run afoul of the sanctions imposed on China,"" Myllyvirta said.

""This line does mean that China's imports from Russia are likely to grow simply on market basis, as other buyers move to embargo Russian fossil fuels,"" he said.

Why does China need so much coal

coal to power its economy. As much as 60% of China's electricity output was generated from thermal coal in 2021, while more than 90% of Chinese steel was produced in blast furnaces that burn coking coal. In general, coal made up 56% of China's total energy use as of last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Despite the pledges to cut its dependence on fossil fuels, China still needscoal to power its economy. As much as 60% of China's electricity output was generated from thermal coal in 2021, while more than 90% of Chinese steel was produced in blast furnaces that burn coking coal. In general, coal made up 56% of China's total energy use as of last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.

""The Chinese government is currently pushing for all kinds of infrastructure and construction projects, which includes coal industry projects, to offset the effect of the real estate slump and Covid lockdowns on other parts of the economy,"" said Myllyvirta.

China has been trying to boost coal production since last year, when a severe power crisis triggered blackouts for millions of households and forced many factories to cut production.

On Thursday, Premier Li Keqiang said that a steady supply of power is critical for China's growth goals.

China will ""resolutely"" prevent any power crunch from happening again this year, Li said during a visit to a power transmission center in Yunnan province, China.

The National Energy Administration has set Chinese mines a target of 4.4 billion tons this year, up 300 million on last year's record output.

And in another effort to guarantee supply, the government cut all import tariffs on coal to zero between May 1 this year and March 30, 2023. Previously, tariffs ranged from 3% to 6%, depending on the type of coal.

Indonesia, China's current No.1 supplier, has enjoyed zero tariffs for years thanks to a free trade pact between China and ASEAN nations. But Russia was still subject to tariffs until this month.

Elon Musk says its dumb to call billionaires the bad guys,2022-05-27 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business) Elon Musk, the world's richest man, said on Twitter Thursday that billionaires aren't the bad guys.

Musk tweeted that it is ""morally wrong & dumb"" to use the word billionaire as a pejorative if that person is using their wealth to create products that make ""millions of people happy.""

He added that if he could, he also would get rid of charitable deductions and class-action lawsuits.

Musk was replying to a tweet that said, ""I feel like billionaires are most benign when trying to make money, and most nefarious when spending it trying to ""do good.""

Musk ran a Twitter poll , asking his 95 million followers who they trust less: politicians or billionaires. As of midday Friday, three-quarters of the 2.8 million respondents said they had less trust for politicians.

He then tagged Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who recently told Bloomberg she wanted to replace her Tesla with an EV made by a company that supports unionization. Musk dared the Democratic congresswoman to run the same poll with her own followers. Musk has largely opposed unionization for Tesla in the past.

""A union is just another corporation,"" Musk said in another Tweet Thursday, which had gained 4,000 likes by midday Friday. ""Far better for companies to compete for your skills, so that you have maximum optionality.""

Musk's pro-billionaire tweets arrived as the World Economic Forum in Davos comes to a close. The annual gathering of millionaires and billionaires has routinely been met with criticism about the failure of the world's wealthiest people to give significant sums to solve the world's biggest problems -- as vulnerable populations across the world are expected to face surging energy prices, extreme weather and soaring food prices this year.

Gabriela Bucher, the executive director of Oxfam International, told CNN Business at Davos this week that governments should tax wealth on the world's wealthiest people.

This is hardly the first time Musk has opined on how billionaires should be spending their money. On Monday, David Beasley, the head of the U.N.'s World Food Program, gave the Associated Press an update on his spat with the billionaire, which was sparked when he said in a 2021 CNN interview that billionaires must step up to combat world hunger.

Beasley suggested that $6 billion, or 2% of Musk's net worth at the time, could help solve the crisis.

""Musk put $6 billion into a foundation. But everybody thought it came to us, but we ain't gotten any of it yet. So I'm hopeful,"" Beasley told the Associated Press at Davos.

Musk then replied to Beasley, tweeting that he would sell Tesla stock ""right now"" if the food program could detail how $6 billion would solve world hunger. Beasley then replied with a 1,000 word ""executive summary"" that mapped out how the UN could utilize the money to feed more than 40 million people across 43 countries.

The WFP has received no funding from Musk. Although Beasley directly asked Musk for help when speaking to the Associated Press, he said he remains hopeful.

""I don't know what it's going to take,"" Beasley said. ""We're trying every angle, you know: Elon, we need your help, brother.""

Elon Musk proves once again that the rules dont apply to him,2022-05-17 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business) How do you regulate a man worth more than $200 billion who thinks he knows better than everyone else? The simple answer is: You don't.

Elon Musk has once again proven he'll do things his own way, announcing Friday that his $44 billion deal to buy Twitter is on hold . He shared this news in a tweet rather than in a formal filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The drama over the deal has continued to play out in a series of tweets between Musk and the company.

Because the SEC ruled back in 2013 that using Twitter and other social media platforms are an acceptable way for public companies to disclose material information, this might be one of the legal ways he's flouted convention.

But many other moves by Musk over the years have broken actual rules, not just skirted norms, yet none of it has slowed him down or changed his behavior.



The financial penalties that regulators or business partners might put in place mean little to someone as wealthy as Musk. He's walking, tweeting proof that normal rules don't apply to the ultra-rich if they choose to ignore them.

One example: Musk recently acquired nearly 10% of Twitter's stock — without making the legally required timely public disclosure.

An investor who buys 5% or more of a company's stock has 10 days to disclose the purchases, so other investors can be aware of what is affecting share prices.

Musk waited 21 days to make the disclosure, by which point he had completed buying 9.6% of Twitter's stock. News of the acquisition sent Twitter shares soaring even before he announced his bid to buy the platform and take it private.

Had Musk made the required timely filing, it likely would have cost him a lot more to accumulate the 15 million shares he bought after the 10 day deadline had come and gone.

The delayed disclosure saved Musk $143 million by keeping the share price lower than it might have been as he continued to buy shares, estimates Daniel Taylor, a University of Pennsylvania accounting professor.

The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the SEC is probing Musk's late reporting of his stake in Twitter.

""I think it could be laziness or the belief that rules don't apply,"" Taylor said. ""But if you look at when the SEC enforces late filing, it's relatively rare. From a cost-benefit basis, it makes sense not to file. Even if the cost for reporting late is a $100,000 fine or a multi-million-dollar fine, why wouldn't he [delay filing]?""

Musk's previous big battle with the SEC back in 2018, when he tweeted that he had ""funding secured"" to take Telsa private , sending shares higher, only emboldened the billionaire.

Musk eventually paid a $20 million fine and gave up his position as chairman of Tesla, although he kept the CEO title, which the SEC had threatened to strip him of as well. He also has to have tweets with material information about Tesla approved by others at the company, but it's not clear how closely he has complied with that requirement over the last four years.

Musk is still seething over that settlement he signed with the SEC, claiming he only did so because banks might otherwise have cut off Tesla's funding and forced the automaker into bankruptcy. But Taylor said the action by the SEC amounted to little more than a slap on the wrist.

""They had the opportunity to send a strong signal and chose not to,"" Taylor said.

Other rules Musk ignores

The regulations on disclosing ownership stakes are only the latest in a long series of rules that Musk has flouted -— with little if any consequence.

Traditional automakers issue recalls when they discover a flaw in the design or construction of a car. That's why the National Highway Safety Administration, the federal regulator, has named the office that looks into consumer complaints and accident data the Office of Defects Investigation.

But Tesla has been ordered to issue recalls for building its cars precisely as planned. Musk has complied, but has also attacked safety regulators for requiring him to make his vehicles less ""fun ."" And Tesla has faced no significant costs for its actions.

Tesla features that prompted recalls include allowing front seat passengers — and conceivably drivers — to play video games on the touch screen in the middle of the dashboard while the car is in motion and enabling cars to deliberately roll through stop signs when in self-driving mode.

Musk has also battled with the Federal Aviation Administration over the testing of SpaceX rockets without the requisite permission. In 2020, for example, the company conducted a brief test flight of its forthcoming Mars rocket, called Starship, without giving the FAA proper documentation or assessments for the risks to "" public health and safety ,"" according to the agency.

Even before the test flight took off, the FAA had denied a safety waiver that SpaceX had requested. But the company moved forward anyway.

An FAA investigation ensued, but SpaceX ultimately walked away with little more than orders for ""corrective action.""

During the early days of the pandemic, Musk reopened his Tesla factory in California that had been shut down due to stay-at-home orders he attacked as "" fascist .""

The county health department, which had ordered the business closures to stem the spread of Covid-19, eventually caved into to his reopening plans

Elon Musk denies sexual harassment claims,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business) Elon Musk denied allegations that he sexually harassed a SpaceX flight attendant in 2016 in a series of late-night tweets.

""I have a challenge to this liar who claims their friend saw me 'exposed' -- describe just one thing, anything at all (scars, tattoos, ...) that isn't known by the public. She won't be able to do so, because it never happened,"" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO tweeted early Friday morning.

The tweet comes after Business Insider reported that SpaceX paid a $250,000 settlement in 2018 after a SpaceX flight attendant alleged sexual misconduct against the billionaire.

Nicholas Carlson, the editor-in-chief of Insider, the parent publication of Business Insider, responded to Musk's denial on Twitter.

""We stand by our story, which is based on documents and interviews and speaks for itself,"" a tweeted statement reads

Citing documents and interviews it conducted, Business Insider reported that ""the attendant worked as a member of the cabin crew on a contract basis for SpaceX's corporate jet fleet. She accused Musk of exposing his erect penis to her, rubbing her leg without consent, and offering to buy her a horse in exchange for an erotic massage.""

In his request to Insider for more time to respond to the allegations, Musk said there was ""a lot more to this story.""

""If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light,"" he told Business Insider. The outlet also said Musk characterized the story as a ""politically motivated hit piece.""

In separate tweets, Musk later denied that he ever responded to Business Insider while they were reporting the story and attempted to link the article to his Thursday announcement that he ""will vote Republican"" and his attempt to acquire Twitter — a deal he recently put ""on hold.""

""Did you actually respond to the reporters from BI?"" one user tweeted at Musk.

""No,"" Musk responded , ""it was clear that their only goal was a hit price (sic) to interfere with the Twitter acquisition. The story was written before they even talked to me.""

""They began brewing attacks of all kinds as soon as the Twitter acquisition was announced,"" Musk added in a separate tweet . ""In my 30 year career, including the entire MeToo era, there's nothing to report, but, as soon as I say I intend to restore free speech to Twitter & vote Republican, suddenly there is.""

The publication reached out to Musk about the story in question before he tweeted about voting Republican, according to John Cook, the investigations editor at Insider.

""For those interested, we reached out to the principals for comment regarding this story at ~9 a.m. eastern yesterday (Wednesday May 18),"" Cook said on Twitter

Musk's tweet declaring his voting intentions was posted at 2:44 pm ET on Wednesday , though he also made comments to that effect in a virtual interview posted to YouTube on May 16.

The Business Insider article states that it ""extended the deadline and reiterated the offer to Musk to comment on the claims. He did not respond.""

Mortgage rates fall slightly but offer little relief to buyers,2022-05-26 00:00:00,"(CNN) Mortgage rates fell for a second consecutive week, but still remain above 5%.

The 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.10% in the week ending May 26, down from 5.25% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. It is still well above the 2.95% average from this time last year.

""Mortgage rates decreased for the second week in a row due to multiple headwinds that the economy is facing,"" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. ""Despite the recent moderation in rates, the housing market has clearly slowed, and the deceleration is spreading to other segments of the economy, such as consumer spending on durable goods.""

Buyers are finding homes even less affordable as inflation takes a larger chunk of their income and the cost of borrowing has reduced their purchasing power. Rates have risen sharply since January, pushing the cost of financing a home significantly higher for buyers.

At the end of May 2021, a buyer who put 20% down on a $375,500 home -- a price just under the median price for an existing home -- and financed the rest with a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage at an average interest rate of 2.95% had a monthly mortgage payment of principal and interest of $1,258, according to numbers from Freddie Mac.","['Anna Bahney', 'Cnn Business']",CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/26/homes/us-homes-mortgage-rates-may-26/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220526082135-us-weekly-home-mortgage-rates-super-tease.jpg
Paris Hilton wants to be the Queen of the Metaverse,2022-05-27 00:00:00,"(CNN) A fuschia Bentley drives down a twisty desert road toward the entrance of the Neon Carnival, an after-party held each year during Coachella. Paris Hilton has arrived. Her hair is in pigtails, twisted in part with white flowers, and she's wearing a sparkly pink romper that matches her platform boots. She greets fans on a red carpet, heads to a packed dance floor and eventually finds her way to the go-karts.

Hilton attends the invite-only party in person each year, but this particular scene played out last month in Paris World, Hilton's virtual experience on popular gaming platform Roblox, where she joined as an avatar. Nearly 400,000 Roblox users visited her virtual Neon Carnival that mid-April weekend, about 40 times the number of people who went in real life this year, according to Hilton. (The digital event was sponsored by Levi's and designed in part by Brent Bolthouse, the founder of the original Neon Carnival).

It's a concept Hilton has seen success with before. On New Year's Eve, she DJed a live set in the same virtual world, playing as her avatar. In Paris World, users can also buy virtual clothing, book a jet ski ride or pay to gain access to a VIP section of a club.

""I've always been an undercover nerd, so I've been obsessed with anything to do with technology and the future,"" Hilton told CNN Business in an interview last month. ""Now my new nickname is 'The Queen of the Metaverse,'"" she added, referring to a sobriquet she has used on the red carpet and in a number of her social media posts, which, according to her company 11:11 Media, first emerged in the NFT space on Twitter.

Hilton has long been a trendsetter. She arguably became an influencer before the term even existed after her reality TV show, ""The Simple Life,"" debuted in 2003. But Hilton, the great-granddaugther of hotel mogul Conrad Hilton, has also been working to redefine her public image as a successful businesswoman and to cement her status as an innovator.

Recently, she's embraced two buzzy but speculative trends in tech: the metaverse, a vision for an immersive virtual world that still does not exist; and non-fungible tokens, known as NFTs, which refer to pieces of digital content linked to the blockchain, the digital ledger system underpinning various cryptocurrencies.

Hilton has invested in multiple tech companies, including backing digital avatar startup Genies and animation app immi , which allows some NFT owners to bring the characters in their digital artwork to life. She also bought a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT, a pricey and highly sought after collection that's attracted celebrity buyers. Hilton has also created her own NFT artwork. One of her latest NFT pieces, called the "" Iconic Crypto Queen "" and created in collaboration with popular NFT artist Blake Kathryn, sold for $1.111 million -- a nod to 11:11 Media, Hilton's new company named after her favorite time of day.

While the future of both the metaverse and NFTs remains unclear, arguably all the more so for the latter after a crypto market crash this month, some say there is real potential for celebrities who embrace virtual gatherings and products. ""For celebrities, like brands, this is another way for them to engage with their fans and audiences,"" said Michael Inouye, a principal analyst at ABI Research. ""This could be through virtual events, concerts, shows and more. They could sell virtual merchandise so fans could show their fandom both in their real and virtual lives.""

Her bet on these digital products and services is just one piece of Hilton's growing empire. Last fall, Hilton brought all of her initiatives under 11:11 Media. The company includes her 19 product lines, such as fragrances, clothing and makeup, which have surpassed over $4 billion in all-time revenue, according to the company. It also includes her production company Slivington Manor Entertainment -- which is behind TV projects including ""Cooking with Paris"" and ""Paris Hilton in Love"" -- and her podcast company London Audio.

""We are growing quickly and want to find the talent of people who are interested in this space,"" said Hilton. To that end, Hilton is partnering with ZipRecruiter, an online platform for job seekers, to add more employees to her roster. 11:11 Media is soon launching a sweepstakes for someone to win a mentorship program with her in Los Angeles to learn many of the aspects of running her business.

""Mentorship is also something that's really important for me. My mentor was my grandfather,"" she said of the late Barron Hilton, the business magnate who was the former president, chairman and CEO of Hilton Hotels Corporation. ""It's just all the advice he gave me and the support has really stuck with me throughout my career. I want to be able to do that for someone else.""

A voice for NFTs

In 2019, Hilton emerged as one of the earliest celebrity promoters of NFTs. She was approached by a friend who was raising money for recovery efforts related to Australia's wildfires at the time. When Hilton was asked to create a digital art piece on her iPad, she drew one of her cats, Munchkin. All proceeds went to charity.

""I then found myself on sites such as Clubhouse during the pandemic talking to artists about the NFT world and meeting with leaders in the space,"" she said. ""I became obsessed with it and started collaborating with artists. ... It's something I really believe in.""

Since then, she has become a public voice for NFTs. During an appearance on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"" earlier this year, Hilton and Fallon shared pictures of their Bored Ape NFTs in a conversation that one news outlet described as ""frankly, hallucinogenic."" The year before, she used her time on the show to school Fallon on how NFTs work.

Other celebrities including Snoop Dogg, Lindsay Lohan and Shawn Mendes have launched their own NFTs. But recently there have been signs the NFT market may be deflating. The NFT market declined to a daily average of about 19,000 sales earlier this month compared to 225,000 in September, according to data cited by the Wall Street Journal.

In 2021, then-Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey sold his first-ever published tweet as an NFT, for cryptocurrency valued at $2.9 million, but when the man who purchased it put it up for sale, it attracted offers at a fraction of the price.

The price of Bitcoin -- the largest cryptocurrency -- dropped below $30,000 earlier this month and has struggled to rise above that level since then. It remains down more than 50% from its record high in November. Other cryptocurrencies have been hit hard too in recent weeks.

Along with the risks associated with the volatility of NFTs and the broader crypto space, scams and thefts also persist. Some celebrities have also had class-action lawsuits filed against them for allegedly participating in so-called ""pump and dump"" crypto schemes.

""These have usually been associated with cryptocurrencies where the celebrity will hype it up and then when people invest in it they in turn around and sell their currency at a profit,"" said Inouye. ""This speaks to the less savory side of all of NFT-blockchain-crypto, which is at least in part driven by hype and speculation.""

Hilton said she's been cautious not to give advice on what people should buy, noting she's only interested in NFTs to ""support the artists"" and ""not for investment reasons.""

A public perception shift

Hilton has proven herself as a successful entrepreneur for years but she said public perception of her -- which was fixated on her heiress and socialite status -- didn't shift until the release of 2020 documentary ""This is Paris."" The film, released on YouTube and since viewed more than 58 million times, called out the mistreatment she allegedly faced at a boarding school facility as a teenager.

""The documentary changed my life in every single way,"" she said. ""For so long, people had so many misconceptions of me because of the character I was playing ... almost like a coping mechanism. Now they understand who I actually am and what I've been through. I'm not a dumb blonde. I'm just very good at pretending to be one.""

Since the release of the documentary, she has worked to change laws in seven states as part of an effort to crack down on abusive youth facilities . Earlier this month, Hilton visited the White House to discuss new legislation aimed protecting children in such programs.

""I will always be grateful to 'The Simple Life' because it really helped me launch my brand and all my businesses. But there is so much more to me,"" she said. ""I want to be known and respected for the businesswoman I am, the business and brand that I've created and for being an advocate for children who have suffered from the abuse and trauma that myself and so many others have.""

Hilton said she continues to look for new ways to innovate on and offline, grow her NFT collection and help others grow their own brands.

""It's amazing now with the technology available to anyone from their living room -- if they have Wi-Fi connection, an iPhone or whatever they're capturing their content on -- they are able to build a brand, support their families, be themselves and express themselves in that way,"" she said. ""It makes me proud that I created this new genre of a celebrity. ... I love being an innovator and someone who is a first at things. It's just incredible to see what that's morphed into.""","['Samantha Murphy Kelly', 'Cnn Business']",CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/tech/paris-hilton-metaverse/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220527150215-paris-hilton-metaverse-dress-0322-super-tease.jpg

CNN Business —

Millions of students who participated in virtual learning during the Covid-19 pandemic had their personal data and online behaviors tracked by educational apps and websites without their consent and in many cases shared with third-party advertising technology companies, a new report has found.

Human Rights Watch, an international advocacy organization, this week published the findings of an investigation conducted from March 2021 to August 2021 that looked into the educational services, including online learning tools, used by students all over the world when school districts shifted to remote learning.

Of the 164 products reviewed across 49 countries, Human Rights Watch found 146 (89%) appeared to engage in data practices that “risked or infringed on children’s rights.” These practices included monitoring or having the ability to monitor children without the students’ or parents’ consent, and collecting a range of personal data, according to the report, such as their identity, location, their online activity and behaviors, and information about their family and friends.

“Children, parents, and teachers were largely kept in the dark,” Hye Jung Han, children’s rights and technology researcher at Human Rights Watch, told CNN Business. “But even if they had known what was going on, they had no choice. Children had to either use these products and pay for it with their privacy, or be marked as absent and drop out of school during Covid-19.”

Han said the majority of the apps and websites examined by Human Rights Watch sent information about children to Google and Facebook, which collectively dominate the digital advertising market.

A spokesperson for Facebook-parent Meta told CNN Business the company has policies around how businesses can share children’s data and advertising restrictions for how minors can be targeted. A Google spokesperson said it requires developers and customers to abide by data and privacy protections, and prohibits any personalized or marketing ads aimed at minors’ accounts. “We are investigating the specific report claims and will take appropriate action if we find policy violations,” the spokesperson said.

The report was shared with a consortium of more than a dozen international news outlets, including The Washington Post, The Globe and Mail, and El Mundo.

Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project and a fellow at the NYU School of Law, said the findings add to mounting concerns around the collection of data among young people. In recent months, there has been intense scrutiny from lawmakers about the impact tech platforms have on teens.

“We already knew technologies were being abused and putting children at risk, but this report is really important because it shows the scale of harm and how the same mistake is being made by educators and governments around the world,” he said.

Under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, a US law, policies are in place to provide broad privacy protections for student educational records and protect them from invasive online tracking.

“But schools and tech firms are circumventing the laws we’re supposed to have that make it harder for advertisers to track students and minors online,” Cahn said. “Platforms that, through loopholes, can make students some of the most surveilled individuals on the planet.”

John Davisson, director of litigation and senior counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center, called the issue “a regulatory failure, pure and simple.” But he said he’s encouraged by the Federal Trade Commission recently warning edtech vendors about their obligations to protect children’s privacy.

Last week, the FTC announced plans to crack down on companies illegally surveilling children during online learning. “Students must be able to do their schoolwork without surveillance by companies looking to harvest their data to pad their bottom line,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement. “Parents should not have to choose between their children’s privacy and their participation in the digital classroom.”

Bart Willemsen, an analyst at research firm Gartner who focuses on privacy issues, said schools and ed tech providers have a responsibility to be fully transparent about what they’re potentially doing with data, have detailed control over how it is used, and establish why the data is needed at all.

“The data must serve a purpose, but the purpose cannot be advertising,” he said. “If it is not something we do in physical classrooms, it is not something that should be part of digital school life.”

He also said the collection of this type of information could have a long-lasting impact on their children’s digital footprint, as that data is not easily erased. “Parents have a role here,” he said. “Yet in situations like these, their strongest action is to let their voice be heard.”",['Samantha Murphy Kelly'],CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/26/tech/remote-learning-apps-data-collection/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220525153502-child-virtual-learning-laptop-stock.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill"
Apple boosts starting pay for US workers to 22 per hour,2022-05-26 00:00:00,"Apple will raise the starting pay for its US employees, the iPhone maker said on Wednesday, as companies face a tight labor market and a surge in unionization efforts amid rising inflation.
The starting pay for the company's US team members will rise to $22 per hour, or higher based upon the market, a 45% jump from 2018 levels, Apple (AAPL) said in a statement to Reuters.
""This year as part of our annual performance review process, we're increasing our overall compensation budget,"" a company spokesperson said.
Apple has informed some workers their annual reviews would be advanced by three months and the new pay will take effect in early July, the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the changes in compensation, said.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for further details on the compensation changes.
Cupertino, California-based Apple is known for its reticent culture, but last year some current and former workers began criticizing the company's working conditions online.
In April, workers at Apple's Atlanta store filed a petition to hold a union election, seeking to become the company's first US store to unionize amid a wave of labor activity at other major firms. 
Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) are among other tech companies that have revised performance reviews or adjusted pay this year as they fight to retain workers.

They should know the cost Would graphic images change the gun rights debate,2022-05-29 00:00:00,"New York (CNN) There's a growing debate among journalists over how to report on the victims of mass shootings. Some argue that if lawmakers and American citizens were able to see the graphic images of dead bodies in classrooms, there could be a shift in how some in the country approach gun rights.

Temple University's journalism school dean David Boardman tweeted on Tuesday that he couldn't have imagined advocating for this just a few years ago.

""It's time, with the permission of a surviving parent, to show what a slaughtered 7-year-old looks like,"" Boardman tweeted

Boardman was reacting to last week's school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, where an 18-year old with a legally purchased AR-15 rifle slaughtered 19 children and two adults in a classroom at Robb Elementary School.

The debate about allowing lawmakers and citizens to see graphic images of gun carnage is still theoretical — there are no photos circulating from Uvalde — but many are arguing it's time to stop sanitizing mass shootings.

John Woodrow Cox, a Washington Post enterprise reporter and the author of ""Children Under Fire"" is conflicted himself. He told CNN chief media correspondent Brian Stelter that many people don't understand how bullets from high-powered rifles destroy childrens' bodies.

Lawmakers who vote against assault weapons bans should be required to see those images, Cox said.

John Woodrow Cox speaks with CNN on Sunday, May 29.

""If they're going to make that choice and say that anybody should have access to those guns, then they should know the cost,"" Cox said on ""Reliable Sources"" Sunday. ""They should know the price that children pay in graphic form, and if they can live with that, fine.""

Cox has been covering the gun violence beat for years, interviewing young victims months and even years after the initial trauma. And he's faced ethical dilemmas.

The youngest victim he's ever interviewed was a 4 year-old who was shot in the head during a drive by shooting in Cleveland, Ohio, in 2017.

""Most of these kids are desperate to share their stories. They're desperate to be heard,"" Cox said. ""Because often the survivors are overlooked.""

Cox said most Americans still haven't grasped the scope of gun violence in this country, which affects millions of children. And the vast majority of shootings are still overlooked by the mass media, he said.

It's a heavy beat. And on Tuesday, Cox decided to see a therapist for the first time.

""The weight of having covered this for five years and having written a book about it and having immersed in these kids agony for so long,"" Cox said, ""it hit me as those numbers were getting bigger and bigger and bigger on Tuesday.""

Yet Cox called it a ""privilege and an honor"" to do the work he's doing.

""We have no choice as reporters but to keep telling these stories, because that, for me, is the only way to wake up one more person,"" Cox said.

And he hasn't lost hope. Cox said that more than half of the school shootings in America since the 1999 Columbine massacre wouldn't have happened if gun owners were forced to lock up their weapons.

If his stories can convince even one gun owner to lock up their gun, then Cox said he may have saved a life. And that's enough to keep going, he said.",['Ramishah Maruf'],CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/29/media/graphic-images-reliable-sources/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220526224515-04-uvalde-shooting-memorial-0526-super-tease.jpg
Top Gun Maverick soars to a big opening at the box office,2022-05-29 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business)""Top Gun: Maverick"" felt the need for speed at the box office this weekend.
The sequel to the 1986 blockbuster, which has Tom Cruise reprise his most iconic role of Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, made an estimated $124 million domestically for its three day opening weekend, according to Paramount.
That not only jets past expectations, which initially projected ""Maverick"" to make closer to $80 million, but stands as Cruise's biggest opening weekend in his more than 40-year career. It's Cruise's first $100 million opening weekend and the third biggest debut of the year.
Paramount said that ""Maverick"" is projected to make $151 million over the four-day Memorial Day weekend at the US box office. If the sequel, which has Cruise's Maverick teaching a new group of Top Gun pilots, lands at that number Monday, it'll be one of the highest openings ever for a Memorial Day weekend.
Globally the film has earned $248 million so far, according to Paramount, which said that  55% of the US total came from ticket buyers over age 35.
""Maverick"" had a lot of buzz coming into this weekend with anticipation running high and reviews even higher at 97% on review site Rotten Tomatoes.
So the big weekend is a victory for Cruise, Paramount (PGRE), and especially theaters. 
""Maverick"" was supposed to hit cineplexes in 2020, but was delayed multiple times because of the pandemic. Other theatrical films pivoted to streaming, but ""Maverick"" waited until audiences could experience it on the big screen — a strategy Cruise was adamant about.
That strategy paid off, and demonstrates that the big screen experience still matters to a large swath of consumers.
""The stellar performance of 'Top Gun: Maverick' marks an important turning point,"" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at Comscore (SCOR), told CNN Business. ""This is a very important weekend for both the industry and Cruise who has demonstrated his undeniable star power and status as a true movie star in an era where this type of distinction has become increasingly rare."" 
The other good news for ""Maverick"" is that it could have legs at the box office in the weeks to come. The film garnered a perfect ""A+"" CinemaScore and has relatively no competition at the box office until ""Jurassic World: Dominion"" opens in two weeks.
""'Top Gun: Maverick' has a clear runway,"" Dergarabedian added. ""By the time 'Jurassic' hits theaters, ['Maverick'] will likely have already generated blockbuster numbers. It should enjoy a solid playability in theaters for the rest of the summer.""

Top Gun Maverick is about to give Tom Cruise his biggest opening ever,2022-05-27 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business) Tom Cruise , one of the top movie stars in Hollywood, is about to have the biggest opening weekend of his career.

The Paramount film — which has Cruise's Maverick teaching a new class of Top Gun recruits — is expected to make roughly $120 million for its three-day opening. That will easily make ""Maverick"" the highest-grossing debut in Cruise's 40 year career, overtaking ""War of the Worlds,"" which opened to $64.8 million in 2005.

Cruise and Paramount are already on target for a big weekend, with the film making $51.8 million for its opening day. The film is also on track for a $150 million opening over the four-day holiday weekend.

""Tom Cruise is one of the few true movie stars left in the business,"" Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at, told CNN Business. ""His name on the marquee means something to audiences who have come to trust that his films will be worth every dollar of that movie ticket purchase.""

Cruise Control

""Top Gun: Maverick"" is set to become Tom Cruise's biggest opening.

It might seem odd that none of Cruise's films have had an opening in excess of $65 million, but that's because Cruise is the Hank Aaron of the movies — a reliable and consistent hit maker — who has notched more than $10 billion at the global box office since 1981 despite his films never coming close to a $100 million opening.

""Cruise is all about the marathon, not the sprint, when it comes to his performance at the box office,"" Dergarabedian said. ""The consistency of his bankability over his more than four decades on the big screen is virtually unrivaled.""

""Maverick"" was supposed to hit theaters in 2020 , but was delayed because of the pandemic. Other theatrical films pivoted to streaming, but ""Maverick"" waited and waited until audiences could experience it on the big screen — a strategy Cruise was adamant about.

Holding the release for two years has paid off, with the film garnering great reviews. It currently has a near perfect 97% score on review site Rotten Tomatoes.

""'Maverick' is virtually assured to become his biggest career opening at this point,"" Shawn Robbins, chief analyst at BoxOffice.com, told CNN Business. ""Everything is in its favor, from strong reviews to social media buzz, ticket pre-sales, and an eager audience that has waited for a sequel to his career-making role for a very long time.""

Robbins added that younger moviegoers ""drive the lion's share of box office business,"" but even though ""Maverick"" comes 36 years after the original, it still matters.

""Make no mistake, this is still a very important film for helping to bring back more pandemic era stragglers of a certain age that can still make a difference for the overall health of the industry as it continues to recover,"" Robbins said.

Climbing Back Up The Mountain

Paramount is having a great year. It could fly even higher with ""Top Gun: Maverick.""

How ""Maverick"" fares at the box office also matters a lot to Paramount.

Paramount PGRE Much like it's famed snowy mountaintop logo,used to be at the top of the mountain in Hollywood, producing mega hits including ""The Godfather,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and ""Titanic.""

Recently, though, the studio has struggled to find its footing in an ever-evolving film industry. It's been more than a decade since Paramount placed first in yearly box office market share.

Disney DIS Yet the studio is doing great in 2022, and is currently in third place thanks to hit films "" Scream ,"" ""The Lost City"" and "" Sonic the Hedgehog 2 ."" Paramount has even made more thanso far this year. And with ""Maverick"" set to take off this weekend, Paramount's 2022 could fly even higher.

""Paramount has been one of the studios at the forefront of movie going's rebound,"" Robbins said. ""From a philosophical standpoint, because of what their presence on the big screen has meant for theatrical exhibition, it might very well prove to be one of the most important years in Paramount's storied history.""","['Frank Pallotta', 'Cnn Business']",CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/27/media/top-gun-maverick-opening-tom-cruise-box-office/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220511103737-03-top-gun-maverick-super-tease.jpg
Why labgrown diamond sales are surging,2022-04-27 00:00:00,"New York (CNNBusiness) It's proposal season, and engagements are on the rise. So are factory-made diamond sales.

Not that you'd know the difference. Man-made diamonds look the same as naturally occurring ones. The only noticeable difference is the price tag.

""The result is really stunning,"" said Edahn Golan, an independent diamond industry analyst.

He said March data showed the number of engagement rings sold that featured a manufactured diamond jumped 63% compared to last year, while the number of engagement rings sold with a natural diamond declined 25% in the same period.

Going back by another month, to February, the data showed the number of rings sold with lab diamonds that month surged even more, to 80% compared to a year earlier while the number fell by 13% for natural diamond engagement rings.

""The big fear in the natural diamonds industry is that consumers will start accepting lab-grown diamonds in engagement rings,"" he said. Too late. ""It's actually happening.""

Tide is shifting

Why are consumers flocking to man-made diamonds? Cost is the most obvious reason. The average retail price of the most popular one carat round man-made diamond for an engagement ring in March was $2,318, Golan said.

""This is substantially less -- as much as 73% cheaper -- than a natural diamond of the same size, cut and clarity as the man-made diamond, which would cost $8,740,"" he said. Plus, the lower cost allows couples to buy a bigger stone.

""A lab diamond is a real diamond, but maybe it took a few weeks to make it,"" said Golan. ""Natural diamonds were formed over 800 million to three billion years and there isn't an infinite supply of them.""

This makes natural diamonds quite a bit more expensive, and prices are likely to rise as Russia's invasion of Ukraine has tightened the supply chain for natural raw diamonds.

Kay Jewelers THE LEO Legacy lab-created diamond three-stone engagement ring 1 ct tw in 14K white gold (price$2,999.99)

The sanctions directly target Alrosa , partly owned by the Russian government, which the US government identified as the world's largest diamond mining company, accounting for 28% of global diamond output.

Man-made diamonds are also becoming popular as consumers are more aware and educated about them, said Dan Moran, a third-generation diamond expert and owner of LA-based fine jeweler Concierge Diamonds. Moran said the typical buyer of man-made diamonds is typically younger than 40 and very budget conscious.

Mined diamonds have a controversial history that's tied to the use of child labor in some African diamond mines as well as sales of illegally-traded ""conflict diamonds"" that fund conflict in war-torn areas.

Among Millennials and Gen Z, their eco-conscious mindset and ethical concerns about natural diamond sourcing is another factor influencing their preference for non-traditional engagement rings, according to a report from wedding planning website The Knot.

Small but growing share of the diamond market

Although its slice is growing, the market share for man-made diamonds remains relatively small.

Currently, about 7% of the specialty diamond jewelry market is represented by man-made diamonds, up from 3% in 2020, said Golan.

Pandora PANDY Some major jewelry retailers are driving the effort to take man-made diamonds mainstream. In 2021, the world's largest jewelry company,, made a major shift by announcing it would stop using mined diamonds and would swap to lab-created diamonds in its jewelry.

Pandora said it's instituting the change as part of an effort to sell sustainable jewelry, and also because consumers increasingly are asking for it.

Signet, SIG the largest jewelry company in the United States (which owns Zales, Kay Jewelers and Jared chains) called out the popularity of lab diamond jewelry in its March earnings call with analysts.

This engagement ring from Concierge diamonds has a 1ct lab grown diamond with 2 pink sapphires in a14K yellow gold band. (Prices start at $3,500 depending on the center diamond)

Calling it a ""fast-growing category"" in its jewelry portfolio, Signet CEO Virginia Drosos told analysts that lab-created diamonds are among the big jewelry trends she expects this year.

The company said it has expanded its man-made bridal jewelry selection in both its Zales and Kay Jewelers stores in response to the increased demand.

Fine jewelry brand Charles and Colvard, which makes lab-created diamonds, said consumers don't just want to look good with the jewelry they are wearing, they also want to feel good about it.

""As the momentum for conscious consumerism grows, the surge towards lab grown diamonds isn't surprising,"" said Don O'Connell, president and CEO of Charles & Colvard. ""[Consumers] want to know the origins of their stones and be reassured they're conflict-free. They're embracing the choice to purchase a piece of fine jewelry that aligns with their values.""

Lab-grown diamond brand VRAI said the pandemic, too, has sparked attention and action toward social and environmental issues. It said consumers are being more thoughtful and reassessing their purchasing habits, as well as the companies and industries they are supporting.

There is, however, one important consideration for anyone buying lab-created diamonds: Man-made diamonds have little resale value.

So while you may not be able to tell a natural diamond from a factory made variety, someone with a trained eye can, said Golan. Once a stone is identified as a factory diamond, even though you paid a lot less for it, you also won't get much for it.

But the value of a ring isn't just monetary.

""As a professional in the industry, I am asked all the time by people about what I think about a ring they have,"" said Moran, of Concierge Jewelers. ""I always say, if you love it, be happy with it. An engagement ring is a symbol of commitment and enduring love.""","['Parija Kavilanz', 'Cnn Business']",CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/27/business/diamonds-manmade-demand/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220426115726-20220426-diamond-ring-composite-graphic-super-tease.jpg
The Chevrolet Corvette is officially going electric,2022-04-25 00:00:00,"(CNN) General Motors will produce a fully electric Chevrolet Corvette, GM President Mark Reuss announced in a LinkedIn post Monday morning.

Reuss didn't say when the electric Corvette would come, but he hinted that a hybrid model could come relatively soon. ""We will offer an electrified Corvette as early as next year,"" he wrote. An accompanying video the company posted to Twitter showed what appeared to be a hybrid Corvette, and in another first, showed the front wheels spinning and throwing snow as if being powered. All Corvettes produced by the company previously have been rear-wheel-drive only.

While Reuss's post implies a hybrid Corvette will be based on the current generation of the car, it's not clear if the all-electric version will be a variation of this car or a completely different future model.

""Electrified"" is an auto industry term encompassing everything from hybrid to fully electric vehicles, and anything with an electric motor can count as ""electrified."" It has long been rumored that the current generation of the Corvette , the first with its gasoline engine mounted behind the seats instead of in the front, could be built with a hybrid system. Reuss has also previously hinted there would be electrified variants of the car.

Various companies are working on electric sports cars. Most all-electric vehicles in production so far have been four-door sedans and SUVs, as the need for batteries lends itself to larger and heavier vehicles. Tesla's first car, the Lotus Elise-based Tesla Roadster, was an electric sports car, but the second-generation of Tesla Roadster, originally unveiled as a prototype in 2017, has yet to go into production.","['Peter Valdes-Dapena', 'Cnn Business']",CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/business/electric-hybrid-corvette/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/190718101317-03-new-gm-chevrolet-corvette-super-tease.jpg

CNN —

The parent company of Facebook and Instagram is taking on a new role as a brick-and-mortar retailer.

On Monday, Meta announced the Meta Store, which will be the company’s first attempt at selling its physical products — including the Quest 2 virtual reality headset and Portal video calling device — directly to consumers in person. The store will also offer demos of the Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses that were developed with Ray-Ban, but customers who want to buy them will be directed to a Ray-Ban website to do so, Meta said.

Unlike, say, the Apple Store, there will only be one Meta Store for now, and it will be based at the company’s campus in Burlingame, California (specifically, at 322 Airport Boulevard).

Meta is the latest big tech company to open a retail store to showcase its hardware. Google opened one such store in New York last year. Microsoft shuttered its 83 stores in 2020, but reconfigured a few as “experience centers” and started selling products at them in 2021. And Apple has made its hundreds of stores a core part of its business for years.

The store will open May 9, Meta said. It is, in part, an effort to get consumers more familiar with Meta’s plans for a so-called “metaverse” —- a sci-fi concept that envisions, essentially, an immersive version of the internet, which the company spent billions of dollars on last year via Facebook Reality Labs.

In a blog post on Monday, Meta said the store will let people demo various products and will include a VR space that lets customers try apps such as Beat Saber and Real VR Fishing. These VR demos will be projected on an enormous, curved LED screen in the store for others to see.

“The Meta Store is going to help people make that connection to how our products can be the gateway to the metaverse in the future,” Meta Store head Martin Gilliard said in the blog post.

Because the store will be based on Meta’s corporate grounds, it will also give Meta employees “more opportunity to experiment and keep the customer experience core to our development,” Gilliard said.

Meta is the leader in the small but rapidly growing market for VR headsets. Tech market researcher IDC estimates nearly 11 million VR headsets were shipped in 2021, which is a 96% jump over the 5.6 million shipped a year before, research manager Jitesh Ubrani said. Ubrani believes Meta’s Quest 2 headset made up 80% of those shipments last year.

It’s not yet clear if Meta plans to eventually take the Meta Store beyond Burlingame, similar to what Apple began in 2001 with the rapid rollout of its Apple Stores around the world. A Meta spokesperson said the company had no details to share about whether it might open any stores beyond the first one.",['Rachel Metz'],CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/25/tech/meta-facebook-store/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220422165606-02-meta-store.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill"
Amazon to let other online retailers offer Prime delivery service directly on their sites,2022-04-21 00:00:00," (CNN Business)Amazon announced Thursday that it will let third-party merchants offer Prime membership benefits such as free and fast shipping directly to Prime customers through their own online stores rather than solely through the e-commerce giant's platform.
The option, called Buy with Prime, will initially be available by invitation only for merchants already using Fulfillment by Amazon, the service that lets businesses send products to Amazon (AMZN) fulfillment centers and have the tech company handle the packing, shipping, returns and customer service. 
Prime subscription members will see the Prime logo on eligible products in other merchants' online stores, and they can choose to check out with the payment and shipping information stored on their Amazon account. 
The move, which potentially loosens Amazon's grip on other online merchants, comes as Amazon has faced renewed antitrust scrutiny in part for allegedly giving itself an unfair advantage over third-party sellers. Amazon has come under fire for allegedly using data from individual third-party sellers to inform the development of its own private brand products. Amazon has denied it does so.
With this new option, Amazon also appears to be taking aim at the rise of services like Shopify, which helps businesses run their own online stores. Demand for Shopify spiked during the pandemic amid a broader e-commerce boom. Shopify's lure for many businesses was that it allowed companies to maintain closer relationships with customers and have more control over their online shops. (Shopify has seen its stock price fall considerably this year as its pandemic boom appears to ease.)  
Shares of Shopify (SHOP) fell more than 8% on Thursday.
Amazon is positioning Buy with Prime as a win for merchants who want to build their relationships with customers but still gain access to Amazon's coveted logistics and shipping infrastructure. 
""Allowing merchants to offer Prime shopping benefits on their own direct-to-consumer online stores is an exciting next step in our mission to help merchants of all sizes grow their business — whether on Amazon or beyond,"" Peter Larsen, Amazon's vice president of Buy with Prime, said in a statement Thursday. ""With shoppers purchasing directly from merchants' online stores, Buy with Prime will allow merchants to build customer relationships and brand loyalty while offering conversion-driving benefits like fast, free shipping.""
The Buy with Prime option will cost merchants an undisclosed sum that is calculated based on usage, the company said. No long-term contract is required.

New York CNN Business —

Richard Branson’s space tourism startup, Virgin Galactic, is showing off a luxurious lounge area and top-shelf amenities for its wealthy clientele.

President John F. Kennedy’s iconic 1962 speech, directing the United States to put boots on the moon within the decade, set in motion a leap in innovation. In just seven years, America went from lagging the Soviet Union in space technology to planting a flag on the lunar surface.

The Apollo program was the birthplace of the modern tech ecosystem, says Basil Hero, a former investigative reporter and media executive who authored the new book “The Mission of a Lifetime.”

“Without [Apollo], I don’t think the computer revolution would have happened as quickly and on the same trajectory,” Hero told CNN Business. “It would have taken an extra 10 or 20 years.”

Apollo, the startup

NASA’s Apollo program was the first-ever “moonshot.” And the ingredients that led to its success were a whatever-it-takes attitude, loose management structures, and deep funding.

Kennedy estimated early on that the first moon landing would cost about $7 billion to $9 billion. But the first thing James E. Webb did when he became NASA’s administrator in 1961 was tell Kennedy to double that amount. It was a move “any venture capitalist who has funded a high-tech startup would understand,” Hero writes in “The Mission of a Lifetime.”

The most common mistake entrepreneurs make is insisting they can launch their companies on the cheap, Hero said. They can end up low-balling their way out of business.

Congress was the Apollo program’s financial backer, writing big checks year after year. Lawmakers even authorized NASA in 1962 to offer “supergrade” salaries so that the space agency could afford to hire the best and brightest, Hero notes in his book.

But, NASA could not lumber along as a bureaucratic regime if it wanted to blast humans to the moon in less than 10 years.

Enter George Mueller. He left a prestigious career at research groups such as Bell Labs to lead NASA’s human spaceflight program in 1963. The space agency’s history office describes him as “a no-nonsense, forward-thinking leader” who “introduced a remarkable series of management changes.”

Mueller created a “flat organization” structure: He cut out middle management and “made sure that the engineers on the front line were able to get their concerns straight up to the top people of NASA,” Hero said. If safety concerns were raised or an idea just wasn’t working out, decision makers listened and quickly shifted course.

“They really did trust people in the lower levels, and the engineers benefited from that,” Hero said.

Today, California’s hive of startups and tech giants, from Facebook to Google, still swear by the same management technique.

“Our goal is to inspire people more than manage them,” Netflix (NFLX) notes in its widely influential workplace culture manifesto. “We trust our teams to do what they think is best for Netflix (NFLX) — giving them lots of freedom, power, and information in support of their decisions.”

Apollo managers also had no problem bringing in young visionaries to take on unprecedented tasks, a move emulated by Silicon Valley and its obsession with young minds thinking outside the box.

Mission Control in Houston, Texas, for example, was an operation that had no precursor, and no one knew how to run it. So its manager, Christopher Kraft, brought in a bunch of ambitious 20-somethings. The average age of Mission Control employees during the Apollo 11 moon landing was just 26, Hero notes.

Making more moonshots

In terms of computing power, a modern cellphone could outdo the entire Apollo spacecraft, physicist Michio Kaku wrote in a 2011 book.

The digital revolution that followed Apollo was no accident. Microsoft’s Bill Gates and Apple’s Steve Jobs built off computing technology that NASA incubated during the Apollo era, Hero said.

Some of the tech titans that dominate today’s headlines credit NASA and Apollo as a source of inspiration, and a few have Apollo-like ambitions of their own.

Elon Musk, who made a fortune off Paypal (PYPL) and now runs Tesla (TSLA) and SpaceX, declared that he will relentlessly pursue the goal of reviving deep-space exploration technologies with a rocket that can take humans to Mars.

New York CNN Business —

About 450 miles above Earth, a small satellite is drifting deeper into the cosmos — powered not by rocket fuel, thrusters or other contraptions. This satellite, called LightSail 2, is sailing on a sunbeam.

The prototype spacecraft is the work of the Planetary Society, an international nonprofit headed by famed science communicator Bill Nye. Its mission was declared a success on Wednesday, marking the culmination of a years-long effort to prove a satellite can surf through space using sunlight as an endless fuel supply.

It has nothing to do with solar panels: Plenty of satellites already use that technology to convert the sun’s energy to electricity. Solar sailing is a different, centuries-old concept. It suggests spacecraft can be propelled by a slow, constant push from photons, which are light particles that have no mass but still carry momentum.

“It’s counter-intuitive, it’s surprising, and to me it’s very romantic,” Nye told reporters during a a press call Wednesday, “to be sailing on sunbeams.”

The Planetary Society spent a decade working up to the LightSail 2 mission and scraping together the $7 million needed to get the project off the ground. All told, 50,000 supporters from 109 countries donated to the initiative, according to Planetary Society COO Jennifer Vaughn.

LightSail 2 boarded its long-awaited flight to space in June, secured alongside two dozen other payloads on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. The satellite reached its intended orbit and, on June 23, it unfurled razor-thin sheets of polyester to form a 32-square-meter sail.

After some trial and error, LightSail 2 was able to maneuver its sail to harness photons’ momentum, which offered a “tiny push no stronger than the weight of a paperclip” each time the spacecraft lapped Earth, according to the Planetary Society.

Years of computer simulations. Countless ground tests. They've all led up to now. The Planetary Society's crowdfunded LightSail 2 spacecraft is successfully raising its orbit solely on the power of sunlight.



Details at https://t.co/GPavdA1grN pic.twitter.com/pfYUN4RCTH — Planetary Society (@exploreplanets) July 31, 2019

The gentle nudges added up. In just a few days, LightSail 2’s distance from Earth grew by about 1.7 km, or about one mile, said project manager David Spencer.

The future of solar sail

The first solar sail prototype, a product of Japan’s space agency, flew to space in 2010. Planetary Society had hoped to reach that milestone years earlier, but its first solar sail was destroyed during a rocket explosion in 2005.

LightSail 2 was built to be the best-performing solar sail yet. After its successful flight, Nye said, Planetary Society was now ready to pass the baton off to other organizations.

“We have no plans to do a third light sail right now,” he said. Though he listed a few types of exploration missions he hoped to see powered by solar sails — including long-distance trips to rendezvous with threatening asteroids, or missions to monitor the sun’s weather and provide warning for potentially catastrophic solar flareups.

LightSail 2 does not, however, have any obvious business applications. But the 50,000 backers who put money into the project aren’t expecting to get a dime back, Vaughn said.

New York CNN Business —

Richard Branson’s space tourism startup, Virgin Galactic, is showing off a luxurious lounge area and top-shelf amenities for its wealthy clientele.

It was the first time the experimental craft, nicknamed “Starhopper,” flew free without being tethered to the ground.

SpaceX’s goal was to lift the spacecraft about 65 feet into the air before gently landing it nearby — what’s SpaceX called a “hop test.” It’s not clear exactly how high the craft flew. Footage captured by reporters present at the South Texas launch site show fire and smoke erupting from Starhopper’s massive Raptor rocket engine, obscuring the vehicle from view.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said the flight was a success.

“Water towers *can* fly,” he joked in a tweet, referencing Starhopper’s likeness to a cylindrical water tank. He also shared views of the launch that were captured by a nearby drone and a camera near the Raptor engine.

Musk tweeted that SpaceX will next attempt a 200 meter, or 650 foot, hop test “in a week or two.”

Starhopper’s successful run came one day after a hop attempt was aborted three seconds after the Raptor engine fired up. The craft never left the ground, and stray flames appeared to shoot out from the top of the vehicle, but no serious damage was done. Musk said the hop test was called off because the fuel was “colder than expected,” causing an issue with pressure levels inside the vehicle.

Starhopper is designed to be an early precursor to a deep-space exploration rocket called Starship, and Musk has said rapid development of the technology is a top priority for SpaceX.

The latest design for Starship, which was earlier referred to as BFR, show it riding into orbit atop the most powerful rocket booster ever built. SpaceX hopes to use the launch system to deliver massive loads of satellites into orbit, and eventually to shuttle humans out into the solar system to explore and colonize Mars.

Yusaku Maezawa, the Japanese billionaire who landed a deal with SpaceX to one day use a Starship spacecraft to circle the moon, tweeted praised to Musk.

Its a tragedy French winemakers face devastation after worst weather in 30 years,2021-04-14 00:00:00,"London (CNN Business)One of France's biggest export industries is facing a devastating blow after an unusually severe frost earlier this month damaged vineyards across the country, heaping pain on winemakers already reeling from the pandemic and US tariffs. 
The frost has affected 80% of vineyards in France's primary wine growing areas, according to the European Committee of Wine Companies. ""This is expected to cause a yield loss ranging from 25% to up to 50% in some regions,"" the trade body told CNN Business on Wednesday.
The destruction spread across the Rhone Valley, Bordeaux, Burgundy, Champagne, Provence and the Loire Valley, said Anne Colombo, president of the Cornas appellation, a wine-growing area in the Rhone region. 
""In some regions there will be very, very few grapes [this year],"" she said, adding that the frost in Cornas is the worst in more than half a century. 
Winemakers tried to keep air temperatures up by lighting candles and braziers in their vineyards, but in many cases it was not enough to protect their budding vines.

""An important share of the harvest has been lost. It's too early to give a percentage estimate, but in any case it's a tragedy for the winegrowers who have been hit,"" said Christophe Chateau, director of communications at the Bordeaux Wine Council.
The frost also threatens other crops, including beets and rapeseed, according to the National Federation of Farmers' Unions. ""The anguish is immense in vineyards, orchards and fields,"" the organization said in a statement last week. 
Not since 1991 have farms faced such a devastating weather event, according to French Prime Minister Jean Castex. Government spokesperson Gabriel Attal told journalists on Wednesday that in some areas ""almost the whole annual production"" of certain crops could be lost. 
The French Ministry of Agriculture and Food last week activated its ""agricultural calamities"" program, triggering tax relief and other financial support measures for farmers. Government officials held an emergency meeting with bankers, insurers and agricultural representatives on Monday to identify additional support mechanisms.

""To you, the farmers, who all over France have fought tirelessly, night after night, to protect the fruits of your labor, I want to say that we give you our full support in this fight. Stand firm! We are at your side and will remain so,"" French President Emmanuel Macron said on Twitter.
The crisis comes at a particularly difficult time for French winemakers, who are suffering weaker sales as a result of coronavirus lockdowns in key international markets, the collapse of tourism due to the pandemic and US tariffs related to a dispute with the European Union over subsidies to planemakers Airbus (EADSY) and Boeing (BA). 
Exports of French wine and spirits fell nearly 14% to €12.1 billion ($14.5 billion) in 2020, with sales to the United States tumbling 18%, according to the Federation of Wine and Spirits Exporters of France. 
Winemakers grapple with climate crisis 
The frost was particularly damaging for winemakers because it was preceded by unusually warm temperatures, which meant that vines grew faster and earlier than usual, making them more sensitive to the cold.
""France encountered near record warmth from late March to early April,"" said CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. That was followed by a ""brutal Arctic outbreak"" in Europe during the Easter weekend, Myers added. 
Temperatures in the Champagne region went from near 26 degrees Celsius (80 degrees Fahrenheit) to around minus 6 (22 degrees Fahrenheit) in less than a week. ""Although temperatures are closer to normal now, another cold outbreak is on the way,"" said Myers.

Climate change has brought forward growing seasons in France and elsewhere, placing crops at higher risk of damage from cold spells. ""It's when they begin to grow that they are more fragile,"" said Colombo, adding that temperature changes have also affected harvesting. 
""Now we harvest in the first week of September and [20 years ago] it was the last week of September,"" she said.
The National Federation of Farmers' Unions said the episode is a ""stark reminder"" of the importance of preventive measures and ""a risk management regime that meets the climate challenge.""

New York CNN Business —

With Broadway theaters shut down during the pandemic, artists are turning to Clubhouse, a buzzy audio app often used for networking and virtual panels, to create free full-length musicals.

Clubhouse, which is still in beta testing, is an invitation-only app with hundreds of audio chat rooms where its millions of users can talk about a wide range of subjects. For Broadway afficionados, it has provided a platform for actors and artists around the world to connect and get their performing arts fix. And while audio drama isn’t a new concept, Clubhouse users have used their own creative backgrounds to revolutionize the app experience.

On her first day using the app in September 2020, Noelle Chesnut Whitmore — who was on furlough from her music festival marketing job — joined a Clubhouse room called “The Cotton Club.” Created and led by singer-songwriter Bomani X, the room resembled a real-life jazz club experience where people virtually mingle and designated users act as the club’s bartender and DJ. Participants were required to change their profile photos to a black-and-white image of their favorite jazz musician, tapping into Clubhouse’s visual capabilities that are limited to user profile photos.

Whitmore’s “Cotton Club” experience inspired her to find her own way to get creative. Within two months, she began working on a Clubhouse-based “Lion King: The Musical,” connecting with other artists who were interested in pursuing musical opportunities on the app, and it wasn’t long before she saw the benefits. During a music industry panel that Whitmore hosted, she connected with the CEO of Geojam, a rewards-based music platform, which is how she landed her current position as chief marketing officer at the company.

The musical went live on Clubhouse on December 26 with afternoon and evening performances. The production followed the 1994 movie script of “The Lion King” word-for-word, with an added original narration by Mir Harris — a creative strategist who starred in and produced the musical — to compensate for the lack of visual components in the performance.

“Lion King: The Musical” took off, serving as the impetus for other Clubhouse performances, including “The Wiz” and “Dreamgirls.” The musicals revived a century-old form of entertainment: radio drama.

“Audio theater was the standard for our grandparents,” said Sherita Carthon, the casting and creative director for “The Wiz” on Clubhouse. “Through the drop-in audio app, we pulled on the spirit of times past to open up our audience’s imagination through pictures and sound.” Listeners tuned in from as far as Germany and Afghanistan, Carthon said.

“There is no way for a locally based theater production to have that type of reach,” she said.

While many platforms lend themselves to creative use cases for artists, Clubhouse differentiates itself by placing an emphasis on feedback from users, who can recommend features and products that they want to see on the app.

Paul Davison and Rohan Seth, the app’s founders, hold town hall meetings in a Clubhouse room every Sunday, a conversation that is open to all users until the room hits its capacity of 8,000 people. Users who don’t make the cut create overflow rooms so additional people can listen to a live recording of the meeting.

“They tell us what is being rolled out, and we could submit questions on a weekly basis or live to talk about things or suggest product features, and that is definitely not normal for most platforms,” Whitmore said. “We as creators kind of get to influence the app, and what the future of the app is, and I’ve never seen that before.”

Whitmore held auditions for “The Lion King” in Clubhouse rooms, with more than 60 people from countries including the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada trying out, vying for roles in the musical.

When it was finally show time, the “Lion King” cast members kicked off the audio performance by making their profile image a red curtain like those used in theaters. Once the music began, the performers changed their profile pictures, and the icons transitioned into the corresponding character images. Around 5,000 people tuned in for each show — the maximum allowed in a Clubhouse room, which has since increased.

The performance received rave reviews on Twitter, with fanfare extending beyond Clubhouse. During the show’s afternoon debut, #TheLionKingCH was a trending topic on Twitter. “Wasn’t it beautiful? Hats off to director @noellechesnutw and every talented person who brought joy today through #LionKingCH. A gorgeous indie production,” film director Ana DuVernay tweeted after listening to the show on Clubhouse. “Strong and compelling performances. Crew was on point. You all did that! Black excellence on @joinClubhouse. Jus’ sayin’.”

And while the audio experience isn’t comparable to what audience members would experience at in-person shows, with Broadway, theaters and music venues closed, artists are making it work. “A lot of what we do now has been relegated to online, said “Dreamgirls” musical director Elle.Morris.

Leroy Church, Elle.Morris’ fellow cast member, worked as the casting and artistic director for “Dreamgirls” on Clubhouse, but he was part of the Broadway cast of “The Lion King” before the pandemic. Church said putting together a musical on the audio app highlighted how to “bridge the gap to make a digital theater space” and get creative when in-person Broadway shows come back.

Hyundai reveals a new pickup truck but please dont call it that,2021-04-15 00:00:00," (CNN)While it may have an open cargo bed in the back, Hyundai's new Santa Cruz is not a pickup truck. Or, at least, not according to Hyundai. 
Instead, the automaker calls it a ""sport adventure vehicle,"" a term the company says it settled on through customer research. The Santa Cruz combines aspects of a crossover SUV --  an SUV that's engineered like a car -- with a pickup truck. It has seating for as many as five people with a small cargo bed. 

But for all intents and purposes, it's a pickup. The Santa Cruz, which will be built in Hyundai's Montgomery, Alabama, factory, is the Korean automaker's first entry into America's highly competitive pickup market
Big pickups are the best-selling vehicles in America. The Ford F-series, for example, has been the best-selling vehicle of any kind in the US for more than 40 years. But comparing those F-150s, Rams and Silverados to the Santa Cruz is like comparing a Bengal tiger to the housecat on your sofa. 
Hyundai doesn't claim the Santa Cruz is intended to carry big loads or do heavy work. At 196 inches from end to end, It's smaller than most other pickups on the market, even relatively small ones like the Toyota Tacoma or the Honda Ridgeline. Instead, the all-wheel-drive Santa Cruz's four foot long bed is intended to carry outdoor gear that owners wouldn't want muddying up the inside of an SUV. In designing the Santa Cruz, emphasis was placed on occupant comfort and maneuverability, a Hyundai spokesman said,
There is ample lockable storage space within the bed and inside the cab, according to Hyundai, for those things owners don't want left out in the open. The Santa Cruz also comes with a lockable bed cover.
The Santa Cruz will be available with either one of two gas engines, one producing over 190 horsepower and the other over 275. (More definite horsepower figures are not yet available.)  With the stronger engine, it will be able to tow as much as 5,000 pounds, according to Hyundai.
Car/pickup mash-ups are far from new, of course. Some of the earliest pickups were modified Ford Model Ts. Much later, automakers offered vehicles like the Chevrolet El Camino and Ford Ranchero that were low-riding car-based trucks. In the late 20th Century, Subaru offered the tiny Brat, and a few decades later, the Baja. 
Meanwhile, traditional pickups have, themselves, evolved to offer more car-like amenities, such as lockable storage space and even luxury features, like leather seats with massage functions, hi-tech entertainment systems and, in the new F-150, hands-free driving capabilities.

Mercedes new electric car has a nap mode and doors that open for you,2021-04-15 00:00:00," (CNN)Mercedes has unveiled its largest and most luxurious electric car yet. The Mercedes EQS is the battery-powered equivalent of the Mercedes S-Class sedan, the brand's flagship model.
Like the S-Class, the EQS is designed for roominess and comfort. With no need for a large engine, the EQS has a sloping hood, making it reminiscent of cab-forward designs that were at their most popular in the 1990s. It also has a more gently tapered back end. And that, Mercedes designers boast, has helped to make the EQS the most aerodynamically efficient factory-produced passenger car in the world.
To help it slip through the air even more smoothly, the EQS's body automatically lowers slightly at speeds of more than 75 miles an hour, and then a little more at speeds of more than 100 miles an hour. 
The car can go about 480 miles on a charge, according to estimates using European testing standards. (Testing methods used by US agencies tend to yield lower range estimates.)
Like the S-Class, the EQS is intended as a showcase for Mercedes' most advanced technologies. For instance, the doors operate automatically, similarly to those on some Tesla models. Door handles extend automatically as the driver approaches and, as the driver gets closer, the doors open. The door can also close itself when the driver steps on the brake. The driver can also operate the passenger doors to allow others to enter and exit the car.
Inside, the Mercedes EQS has an optional touchscreen system that covers the entire dashboard from the driver's side window to the passenger's. Beneath this immense curved glass panel, there are actually three separate screens -- including one just for the passenger --  but they have the appearance of continuous surface. 
For customers who prefer a more traditional look, the EQS will also be available with a rectangular central touchscreen with the rest of the dashboard is covered in wood, leather or other materials.
The EQS has a special Power Nap program to help drivers get some sleep during a rest stop. It automatically reclines the driver's seat into a resting position, closes the windows and the sunshade across the glass roof. The interior lighting and temperature are also adjusted to create a soothing atmosphere. Relaxing sounds come from the stereo and images of a starry night sky appear on the dashboard screens. After a while, the car begins a  wake-up routine that includes special energizing fragrances and a gentle massage. Finally, the seat back rises and the overhead sunshade opens.
The EQS also offers four-wheel-steering, a feature that is also available on the S-Class sedan. At low speeds, the back wheels turn slightly in the opposite direction from the front wheels. This provides the ability for a large vehicle to turn around in a much smaller space than it could otherwise. At higher speeds, the rear wheels can turn in the same direction as the front for more fluid lane changes.
The EQS will initially be offered in two versions, the rear-wheel-drive 329 horsepower EQS 450+ and the all-wheel-drive 516 horsepower EQS 580. Mercedes hasn't announced pricing for the EQS, but it's expected to be over $100,000. Prices for the gasoline-powered S-Class start at just under $100,000. The EQS will go on sale in the US in the fall of this year.
