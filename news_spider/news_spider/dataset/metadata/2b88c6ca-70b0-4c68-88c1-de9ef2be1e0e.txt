summary:New York (CNN Business) The Justice Department indicted Mining Capital Coin CEO Luiz Capuci Jr. for "allegedly orchestrating a $62 million global investment fraud scheme," the agency said Friday.
Mining Capital Coin, or MCC, is a cryptocurrency mining and investment platform.
The group promised daily returns of 1% for up to a year, the SEC press release says.
But instead, the DOJ alleges, Capuci diverted the funds to his own cryptocurrency wallets.
MCC netted at least $8.1 million from the sale of the mining packages and $3.2 million in initiation fees, which funded a lavish lifestyle, including Lamborghinis, a yacht and real estate, according to the SEC complaint.
