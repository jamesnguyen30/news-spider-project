New York (CNN Business) The S&P 500 fell more than 13% between January and April of this year. That's the worst four-month start to a year since 1939, when longtime legendary investor Warren Buffett was just nine years-old.

Apple AAPL Comparing today's stock market to 83 years ago isn't an entirely apples-to-comparison â€” for one, the S&P was made up of only 90 companies back then. But it has clearly been an abysmal first third of the year for investors from any reference point. The Dow was down 9% through April and the tech-heavy Nasdaq plummeted 21%.

Stocks finished higher on a wild day of trading Monday. The Dow rose 84 points, or 0.3%, after falling more than 525 points earlier in the session. The S&P 500 increased 0.6% while the Nasdaq gained 1.6%.

There is an old Wall Street adage that many investors "sell in May and go away." It's a pithy reference to the theory that bullish traders take a break during the summer and early autumn months and that stocks will typically fall until just before the winter holidays.

But this year the big sell-off may already have happened, as there appears to have been a fair amount of panic-induced stock selling recently. The CNN Business Fear & Greed Index , which measures seven indicators of market sentiment, was in Fear mode after briefly falling into Extreme Fear territory Monday.
