summary:New York (CNN Business) Meta said Thursday it is cutting back on hiring.
The move is one of several shifts the Facebook parent company is making following a period of slower-than-usual growth.
The company still plans to "grow our workforce to ensure we focus on long term impact," the statement said.
The company does not currently have plans for layoffs, but the hiring slowdown marks a reversal from aggressive workforce growth during the first three months of 2022.
Meta plans to slow or halt hiring for most mid- to senior-level positions, and recently also paused hiring early-career engineers.
