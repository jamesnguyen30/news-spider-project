0,Computer chip giant ASML places big bets on a tiny future,2022-05-20 19:11:56,"
VELDHOVEN, Netherlands, May 20 (Reuters) - ASML (ASML.AS), a semiconductor industry and stock market giant, has to think smaller. Or maybe bigger.

It is building machines the size of double-decker buses, weighing over 200 tonnes, in its quest to produce beams of focused light that create the microscopic circuitry on computer chips used in everything from phones and laptops to cars and AI.

The company has enjoyed a rosy decade, its shares leaping 1,000% to take its value past 200 billion euros as it swept up most of the world's business for these lithography systems.


It's now preparing to roll out a new $400 million machine for next-generation chips which it hopes will be its flagship by the late 2020s but for now remains an engineering challenge.

Executives at ASML's headquarters in the Dutch town of Veldhoven told Reuters a prototype was on track to be completed in the first half of 2023. They said the company and longtime R&D partner IMEC were setting up a test lab on the spot - a first - so top chipmakers and their suppliers can explore the machine's properties and prepare to use production models as early as 2025.

Yet, as investors expect further dominance and growth to justify ASML's valuation at 35 times 2021 earnings, there is little margin for error should the company encounter technical or supply-chain snags.

""Every check is green right now,"" said Christophe Fouquet, head of EUV programs at ASML. ""But, you know, we still have to see it all (assembled) together.""

EUV stands for extreme ultraviolet, the wavelength of light used by ASML's most advanced machines.

The fortunes of the project are also important for ASML's customers, chipmakers racing to expand production amid a global shortage. They include U.S. player Intel, South Korea's Samsung and Taiwan's TSMC, the biggest, which makes chips for the likes of Apple, AMD and Nvidia.

Industry specialist Dan Hutcheson of TechInsights, who is not involved with the ASML project, said the new technology - known as a ""High-NA"" version of EUV - could provide a significant advantage to some chipmakers.

""It's a bit like who's got the best gun,"" he said.

""So either ASML makes it happen or they don't make it happen,"" he added. ""But if they make it happen, and you don't have your orders and you miss out on this, you've immediately made yourself non-competitive.""

He said TSMC eclipsed its rivals by integrating ASML's EUV machines first in the late 2010s - a mistake Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has vowed not to make again with High-NA.

Lithography is a key determinant of how small circuitry on a chip can get, with High-NA promising a 66% reduction. Smaller is better in chipmaking, as the more transistors you pack in the same space, the faster and more energy efficient a chip can be.

Circuitry is now approaching the atomic level, leading to predictions that the end is nigh for ""Moore's Law"", a famous 1960's observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years.

""If they (ASML) don't succeed it will become difficult to continue with Moore's Law,"" said Jos Versteeg, an analyst at Dutch-based bank InsingerGilissen, though he noted engineers had defied similar doubts in the past.

FIRST LIGHT ON SILICON

Since 2000, ASML has rapidly taken market share from Japanese competitors Nikon and Canon, which now mainly focus on older technology. ASML controls more than 90% of the lithography market. No competitor is attempting to build an EUV system, citing high development costs.

Shortages of ASML's machines, which cost up to $160 million each, are a bottleneck for chipmakers, who have plans to spend more than $100 billion in the coming years to build extra fabrication plants to meet demand.

The High-NA machines will be about 30% bigger than their predecessors, which themselves require three Boeing 747s to carry them in sections.

IMEC, a non-profit research group that cooperates with companies across the semiconductor industry, believes setting up the lab at ASML could save up to a year in development time.

ASML said it had five orders for pilot machines, which should be delivered in 2024, and ""more than five"" orders from five different customers for faster production models for delivery starting in 2025.

But this is no slam-dunk.

There are formidable challenges in integrating a host of complex components, including an optics system of polished, hyper-smooth curved mirrors, which are being built in a vacuum by Germany's Carl Zeiss.

Versteeg at InsingerGilissen said that while ASML enjoyed a near monopoly, its ""pricing is dependent on the productivity of the machines"". Meanwhile, it must sell EUV tools to the shrinking number of companies that make leading-edge chips, which include memory chip makers SK Hynix and Micron.

ASML is also tied to the wider fortunes of the cyclical chip industry, which some researchers expect to double past $1 trillion in annual sales this decade.

Fouquet worries most about supply-chain issues.

""Right now, and like with every other product, we see some stress in the supply chain, and this is if you ask me today, probably the biggest challenge we have with High-NA.""

1,SP 500 tumbles on verge of confirming bear market,2022-05-20 18:43:15,"
Summary

Summary Companies Ross Stores plunges after cutting 2022 forecast

S&P 500 -1.97%, Nasdaq -2.61%, Dow -1.72%

May 20 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 tumbled on Friday, putting the widely followed benchmark on the verge of confirming it has been in a bear market since hitting a record high in January.

Worries about surging inflation and rising interest rates have pummeled the U.S. stock market this year, with danger signals from Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers this week adding to fears about the economy.

Wall Street opened stronger on Friday morning before turning sharply negative and adding to deep losses sustained earlier in the week.


""Any positivity is being sold in a very heavy and high-volume fashion, and that's very concerning,"" said Keith Buchanan, a portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. ""It feels like it's fear driven.""

The S&P 500 was on track to close down 19.4% from its Jan. 3 record high close. Closing down 20% from that record level would confirm it has been in a bear market since reaching that high, according to a common definition. That would be the S&P 500's second bear market since the 2020 global selloff caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier in Friday's session, the S&P 500 was down almost 21% from its January high.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) was last down 29% from its record close in November 2021.

S&P 500 bear markets

Weighing heavily on the S&P 500, Tesla (TSLA.O) dropped 9.8% after Chief Executive Elon Musk denounced as ""utterly untrue"" claims in a news report that he sexually harassed a flight attendant on a private jet in 2016. read more

Other megacap stocks also fell, with Apple down 2.7% and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) losing 3.7%.

Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors declined, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and industrials (.SPLRCI) down 3.5% and 2.4%, respectively.

Shares of Deere & Co (DE.N) tumbled about 14% after the heavy equipment maker posted downbeat quarterly revenue. read more

Recent disappointing forecasts from big retailers Walmart, Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) and Target Inc (TGT.N) have rattled market sentiment, adding to evidence that rising prices have started to hurt the purchasing power of U.S. consumers.

On Friday, Ross Stores (ROST.O) plunged over 20% after the discount apparel retailer cut its 2022 forecasts for sales and profit, while Vans brand owner VF Corp (VFC.N) gained 3.9% on strong 2023 revenue outlook.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are set for their seventh straight week of losses, their longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001.

The Dow (.DJI) is on track for its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression.

Traders are pricing in 50-basis point rate hikes by the U.S. central bank in June and July.

In afternoon trading, the S&P 500 was down 1.97% at 3,823.92 points.

The Nasdaq declined 2.61% to 11,091.22 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.72% at 30,714.43 points.

S&P 500's busiest trades

Expiration of monthly options contracts on Friday was likely to boost trading volumes and could also add to volatility, especially toward the end of the session.

About two thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.00-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.61-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and 48 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 10 new highs and 325 new lows.

2,Tinderowner Match says Google to allow alternate payment systems for now,2022-05-20 17:48:36,"
May 20 (Reuters) - Match Group Inc (MTCH.O) said on Friday that Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google will temporarily allow the dating apps maker to offer users a choice in payment systems.

Match sued Google earlier in May, calling the action a ""last resort"" to prevent Tinder and its other apps from being booted off the Google Play store for refusing to share up to 30% of sales. read more

The date for the trial is currently set for April 2023.


The company said on Friday it has withdrawn its request for a temporary restraining order against Google after it made a number of concessions that would prevent Match's apps from being removed from the Play store for offering alternate payment options.

Match will have to continue to integrate Google Play billing through the trial or until the dispute is settled, Google said.

Match's lawsuit came against the backdrop of ongoing cases brought by ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games, dozens of U.S. state attorneys general and others in targeting Google's allegedly anticompetitive conduct related to the Play store.

Google had said it will block downloads of some of Match's apps by June 1 unless they solely offered Google's payment system and shared revenue, the lawsuit stated.

The majority of users on Match's most popular app, Tinder, prefer its payment system, which allows for installment plans, bank transfers and other features not provided by Google, according to the lawsuit.

Match said on Friday it plans to put up to $40 million into an escrow account, instead of paying Google directly for billing transactions on the Android operating system outside of Google Play store billing, as part of the temporary agreement.

Match has raised concerns over Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) App Store fees and payments policies as well. read more

Apple has also been criticized for building its App Store into a ""walled garden"" meant to extract fees from developers who want to access users on the iOS ecosystem.

Google and Apple charge developers hefty commissions and impose controls on software developers, forcing them to pay a sum when the in-app payment systems are used.

3,Taiwan export orders fall for first time in 2 years hurt by China lockdowns global weakness,2022-05-20 09:30:46,"
Summary Companies April export orders -5.5% y/y vs +3.8% poll forecast

Export orders from China -16.9% y/y vs +9.1% in March

Ministry sees May orders between -1.1% and +1.7% y/y

TAIPEI, May 20 (Reuters) - Taiwan's export orders -- a bellwether for global technology demand -- fell for the first time in 25 months in April, taking a larger-than-expected hit from COVID lockdowns in China and broader global supply chain disruptions.

Export orders unexpectedly fell 5.5% from a year earlier to $51.9 billion last month, data from the Ministry of Economic Affairs showed on Friday.

The decline was the first in more than two years, since the COVID-19 pandemic began sweeping the world in 2020, and up-ended analysts' forecasts for 8.3% growth.


Orders for telecommunications products dropped 21.5% on year, mainly due to government measures to control the spread of COVID-19 in China, the ministry said.

Orders for electronic products edged up 4.3%, with China's lockdowns ""deepening the supply and demand imbalance"", the ministry said.

Growth in the past two years or so had been supported by booming tech demand fuelled by the work and study from home trend during the COVID pandemic, as well as a global semiconductor shortage that has filled Taiwanese chip makers' order books.

The ministry said it expects export orders in May to be in a range of a fall of 1.1% and an expansion of 1.7% from a year earlier.

Huang Yu-ling, director of the ministry's statistics agency, said orders could return to growth in June or July, depending on how quickly China can restore output levels and resolve supply chain bottlenecks.

""The lockdown has had a much bigger impact than we expected,"" she said.

In March, export orders rose 16.8% from a year earlier to $62.69 billion, the highest figure for the month on record.

April orders from China fell 16.9%, compared with an increase of 9.1% in the previous month, while orders from the United States in April dropped 0.2% from a year earlier, compared with the 18.9% growth logged in March.

Shares of California-based Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) tumbled to an 18-month low on Thursday after the company warned of persisting shortages in components, worrying Wall Street on how exports could suffer due to China's COVID restrictions and the Ukraine crisis. read more

Export orders from Europe shrank 17%, compared with growth of 20.1% in March, while those from Japan fell 11.3%.

The ministry said it is closely watching possible further impacts from global supply chain disruptions and rising inflation, both of which could get worse due to the war in Ukraine and the lockdowns in China.

Dozens of Chinese cities were under full or partial COVID lockdowns in April and May, slashing demand and paralysing supply chains. Shanghai is just beginning to ease restrictions and analysts warn it could take weeks or even months for conditions to stabilise.

Roughly half of Taiwanese companies that had previously suspended work in China due to COVID control measures have resumed production as curbs ease, the island's economy minister said on Thursday. read more

Taiwanese companies such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) (2330.TW) are major suppliers to Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) and other global tech firms.

Kevin Wang, an analyst at Taishin investment advisory company, said the impact from China's lockdowns could continue for the next few months.

""The uncertainties from lockdowns in China will still hurt the momentum of the orders and impact the global supply chain. It is hard not to be hit by them.""

May 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower after a volatile session on Thursday, with Cisco Systems slumping after giving a dismal outlook, while investors fretted about inflation and rising interest rates.

Shares of Cisco (CSCO.O) slumped 13.7% after the networking gear maker lowered its 2022 revenue growth outlook, taking a hit from its Russia exit and component shortages related to COVID-19 lockdowns in China. read more

Apple (AAPL.O) and chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) declined 2.5% and 4.3%, respectively, and weighed on the S&P 500.


""The reality is that inflation is running hot and interest rates are rising,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, Minnesota. ""Until you get that inflation rate to start slowing, we're going to have increased volatility, and in our view that continues through throughout most of the summer months.""

Its shares, however, rebounded over 4% after slumping 11% in the previous session due to dismal results from Target Corp (TGT.N).

The S&P 500 is down about 18% from its record close on Jan. 3 as investors adjust to strong inflation, geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine and tightening financial conditions with the U.S. Federal Reserve raising rates.

A close of 20% or more below its January record high would confirm the S&P 500 has been in a bear market since hitting that peak, according to a widely used definition.

5,Tesla cut from SP 500 ESG Index and Elon Musk tweets his fury,2022-05-19 16:13:27,"
In it changes, effective May 2, the sustainability index also added soon-to-be-Musk-controlled Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) while dropping Delta Air Lines and Chevron Corp, according to an announcement.

The back-and-forth over the index changes reflects a wider debate about the metrics used to judge corporate performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, a growing area of investing.


Tesla has become the most valuable auto industry company by pioneering EVs and expanding into battery storage for electric grids and solar-power systems.

Factors contributing to its departure from the index included Tesla's lack of published details related to its low carbon strategy or business conduct codes, said Margaret Dorn, S&P Dow Jones Indices' head of ESG indices for North America, in an interview.

Even though Tesla's products help cut planet-warming emissions, Dorn said, its other issues and lack of disclosures relative to industry peers should raise concerns for investors looking to judge the company across environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.

""You can't just take a company's mission statement at face value, you have to look at their practices across all those key dimensions,"" she said.

Tesla representatives did not immediately respond to questions. The company has previously called ESG methodologies ""fundamentally flawed.""

Musk tweeted that ""Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list! ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.""

Asked about the tweet, a representative for the index provider said Musk may have been referring to a list on a company blog post of the largest 10 constituents by market cap of the S&P 500 ESG Index after the removal of Tesla and others. The list is ""not a ranking of best companies by ESG score,"" the representative said.

Exxon now accounts for 1.443% of the weight of the index. Apple Inc was the largest at 9.657%.

GROWING CONCERNS

Investors concerned about issues like diversity and climate change have poured billions of dollars into funds using ESG criteria to pick stocks, prompting debate about how effectively the funds promote change or whether they push companies too much on issues that should be settled by government policy.

S&P Dow Jones Indices is majority-owned by S&P Global Inc. (SPGI.N) Musk and others have complained the firm and its rivals conflate too many issues by bundling ESG concerns into one total score.

For instance a fund based on the S&P 500 ESG Index, the SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF, received the low rating ""D"" by climate activist research group As You Sow, which noted despite its title and sustainability mandate, fossil fuel stocks make up 6.5% of fund assets.

In the company blog post reviewing changes from April 22, S&P's Dorn said the index aims to keep industries weighted the same as they are in the regular S&P 500 index ""while enhancing the overall sustainability profile of the index."" In practice that means it can keep oil companies while leaving out big players like Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB.O) and Wells Fargo & Co.(WFC.N)

Dorn said Tesla's ESG score had declined slightly from the ""22"" it received last year. At the same time the average score among other automakers improved, pushing Tesla out of the ESG index because of a rule against including lowest-quartile performers.

Dorn and others did not immediately describe other details such as the reasons Twitter or Phillips 66 were added or other companies dropped.

Among other big ESG ratings agencies, MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) gives Tesla an ""average"" ESG rating, while the Sustainalytics unit of Morningstar Inc gives Tesla a ""medium risk"" rating, according to the firms' websites.

On Wednesday a U.S. safety regulator opened a special crash investigation into a Tesla crash this month in California, among more than 30 crashes under investigation involving advanced driver assistance systems. [nL2N2XA2CY]

6,Two major banks expect more pain for US equities,2022-05-19 08:13:51,"
LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Two major banks expect more pain for the U.S. stock markets after benchmark indexes posted on Wednesday their worst one-day losses in two years.

In a report published on Thursday, Barclays strategists said margins for U.S. companies and their forward earnings were under pressure due to a combination of factors, ranging from severity of China's COVID lockdowns to the war in Ukraine and the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish stance.

""Given the numerous negative near-term catalysts for the SPX we believe that the risks remain firmly stacked to the downside,"" they said in a note, referring to the S&P 500 (.SPX).


A key drag on the index had been underwhelming results posted in the current earnings season by the high-flying FAANG group - Meta Platforms (FB.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) - Barclays said. The weak results had been the largest negative contribution to the broader index in seven years.

Moreover, fiscal stimulus unleashed during the pandemic had resulted in record consumption of goods as consumers spent during lockdowns, Barclays said. This had translated into strong corporate earnings in the past two years.

Now that consumer spending was switching to services, support for earnings would not be so strong.

Separately, Goldman Sachs strategists estimated a 35% probability of the U.S. economy entering a recession in the next two years.

Furthermore, investors' behaviour in the U.S. stock market, rotating out of some categories of shares and into others, suggested they were pricing in even greater odds of a downturn.

The S&P 500 is down more than 18% so far in 2022 and the Nasdaq has fallen about 27%, dragged lower by tumbling growth stocks. Almost two-thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs, according to Refinitiv data.

Goldman Sachs said that in 12 recessions since World War Two, U.S. stocks had fallen from peak to trough by a median of 24%.

A decline of that magnitude from the January peak would take stocks 11% below current market levels. An average drop from the peak would be 18%.

Dividend futures represented a second market indicator pricing an outcome consistent with recession, the U.S. investment bank's strategists said. Dividend futures implied S&P 500 dividends would fall by nearly 5% in 2023.

In the past 60 years, trailing four-quarter S&P 500 dividends had never fallen on an annual basis outside of a recession, Goldman Sachs said.

Even retail investors, typically contrarian in recent market selloff episodes, are selling, according to data.

Intra-week selling by retail traders was the worst since March 2020, according to JP Morgan. Charles Schwab net assets suffered outflows for the first time since 2020.

Summary Companies Target Corp loses quarter of value as profit slumps

Megacap growth stocks drag down S&P 500, Nasdaq

Indexes end: S&P 500 -4.04%, Nasdaq -4.73%, Dow -3.57%

May 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Wednesday, with Target losing around a quarter of its stock market value and highlighting worries about the U.S. economy after the retailer became the latest victim of surging prices.

It was the worst one-day loss for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average since June 2020.

Target Corp's (TGT.N) first-quarter profit fell by half and the company warned of a bigger margin hit on rising fuel and freight costs. Its shares fell about 25%, losing about $25 billion in market capitalization, in their worst session since the Black Monday crash on Oct. 19, 1987. read more


The retailer's results come a day after rival Walmart Inc (WMT.N) trimmed its profit forecast. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF dropped 8.3%. read more

""We think the developing impact on retail spending as inflation outpaces wages for even longer than people might have expected is a principal factor in causing the market sell-off today,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""Retailers are starting to reveal the impact of eroding consumer purchasing power.""

Interest-rate sensitive megacap growth stocks added to recent declines and pulled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lower. Amazon (AMZN.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) dropped close to 7%, while Apple (AAPL.O) fell 5.6%.

""The cons outweigh the pros for growth stocks at this particular moment, and the market is trying to decide how bad it's going to get,"" said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. ""The market is fearful of the next six months. We may find out that it doesn't need to be as fearful as this, and markets do tend to overreact on the downside.""

All of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and consumer staples (.SPLRCS) leading the way lower, both down more than 6%.

Rising inflation, the conflict in Ukraine, prolonged supply chain snarls, pandemic-related lockdowns in China and monetary policy tightening by central banks have weighed on financial markets recently, stoking concerns about a global economic slowdown.

Traders are pricing in 50-basis point interest rate hikes by the Fed in June and July.

Unofficially, the S&P 500 declined 4.04% to end the session at 3,923.68 points.

The Nasdaq declined 4.73% to 11,418.15 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 3.57% to 31,490.07 points.

The S&P 500's busiest trades

The S&P 500 is down about 18% so far in 2022 and the Nasdaq has fallen about 27%, hit by tumbling growth stocks. Almost two-thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs, according to Refinitiv data.

Wall Street's recent sell-off has left the S&P 500 trading at around 17 times expected earnings, its lowest PE valuation since the 2020 sell-off caused by the coronavirus pandemic, according to Refinitiv data.

S&P 500's forward PE dips below 10-year average

The CBOE volatility index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, rose to 31 points after falling for six straight sessions.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.5 billion shares, compared with a 13.4 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.52-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 37 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 242 new lows.

8,Celebrating that your job gets to live in your house rentfree Remote work has fueled US house prices during the pandemic  so what happens when people return to the office,2022-05-20 13:05:00,"Remote work has played a big part in the rise in house prices in the U.S. during the first two years of the pandemic, but just how much?

Many fortunate people have had the freedom to live wherever they choose during the pandemic. John Mondragon, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Johannes Wieland, an associate professor from the Department of Economics at the University of California, San Diego, published a paper this week with a bold conclusion: The shift to remote work explains over half of the 23.8% national house price increase between 2019 and November 2021.

The researchers wrote: “​​Our results imply a fundamentals-based explanation for the recent increases in housing costs over speculation or financial factors, and that the evolution of remote work is likely to have large effects on the future path of house prices and inflation.” The paper was distributed Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

The rise in house prices has pleased those who are able and willing to sell, but caused heartache for millions of first-time buyers who yearn to get a foot on the property ladder.

Home prices soared 15.6% year over year in April, reaching a median price of $424,824, according to Redfin RDFN, -4.20% . On average, the number of homes sold fell to 545,706, a decline of 13.2% from the prior year.

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.3% for the week ending May 12, according to data released by Freddie Mac FMCC, -0.21% . To put that in context: The average rate hovered at 2.94% a year ago.

A recent poll from Gallup found that only 30% of Americans believe now is a good time to buy a house. It’s the lowest level on record since Gallup began surveying Americans on this question beginning in 1978, and it’s the first time less than 50% of people across the country thought it was a good time to buy.

Housing costs — which can take up a third of a family’s take-home pay for a middle-income household — have increased by 5.1% in the past year, the fastest annual pace since 1991, while rents are up 4.8% from a year ago, according to the Labor Department.

Another speed bump for employers, if not for housing markets where people fled during the pandemic: There is a reluctance to return to the office among many employees. As one working-from-home employee wrote on Twitter TWTR, +1.31% : “Both of these things are true: the push for returns to the office is absolutely a capitalist death march/celebrating that your job gets to live in your house rent free without compensation is clown s***.” Another wrote: “We want people to return to the office so those building aren’t abandoned and he’ll be forced to house the unhoused in all them empty buildings!!!!”

A group that calls themselves “Apple Together” signed an open letter to the company, claiming 1,400 signatures from workers. “We are not asking for everyone to be forced to work from home,” they wrote. “We are asking to decide for ourselves, together with our teams and direct manager, what kind of arrangement works best for each one of us, be that in an office, work from home, or a hybrid approach. Stop treating us like school kids who need to be told when to be where and what homework to do.” (Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment.)

The latest NBER research details the relationship between remote work and house prices. “Using variation in remote work exposure across U.S. metropolitan areas we estimate that an additional percentage point of remote work causes a 0.93% increase in house prices after controlling for negative spillovers from migration,” the authors wrote. “This cross-sectional estimate combined with the aggregate shift to remote work implies that remote work raised aggregate U.S. house prices by 15.1%.”

But the rise in house prices could reverse as people return to the office. CoreLogic predicts that home prices will slow to a 5% growth rate in 2023, while Fannie Mae FNMA, +0.65% sees a more tepid 4.2% growth next year.

“Our results also imply that the future path of housing costs may depend critically on the path of remote work,” the NBER paper added. “If remote work reverses, then there may be a general reversal in housing demand and potentially house prices. If remote work persists, we may expect important repercussions as increased housing costs feed into inflation and so affect the response of monetary policy.”

9,Crypto Exchange FTX Is Pushing Into Stocks But Whos Trading Anything,2022-05-20 12:24:00,"The U.S. arm of cryptocurrency exchange FTX is pushing into stocks, the latest sign that brokerages are gunning for a model that would allow retail investors to trade a more diverse array of assets at a time when volumes have fallen precipitously.

FTX.US has made equity trading available in a testing phase to a group of customers chosen from a wait list, the company said Thursday. Integrated with FTX’s crypto trading platform, FTX Stocks will allow users to buy and sell the likes of Apple (ticker: AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) stock as well as exchange-traded funds and hundreds of other U.S. securities alongside Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Fractional share trading will be allowed for some securities.

“Our goal is to offer a holistic investing service for our customers across all asset classes,” said FTX.US President Brett Harrison in a statement. “We have created a single integrated platform for retail investors to easily trade crypto, NFTs, and traditional stock offerings through a transparent and intuitive user interface.”

FTX.US said it won’t receive payment for order flow—a controversial way that brokers such as Robinhood Markets (HOOD) subsidize free trading by routing orders through third-party trading firms instead of stock exchanges. Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX’s co-founder and chief executive, has taken a 7.6% stake in Robinhood, according to regulatory filings earlier this month.

“There is clear market demand for a new retail investment experience that offers full order routing transparency to customers and does not rely on payment for order flow,” Harrison said.

FTX.US bucks the trend of traditional finance brokerages moving into cryptocurrencies. Robinhood rolled out crypto trading to more than two million users in April, and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is making a similar push into the world of digital assets.

Instead, with FTX, a crypto-native firm is moving into traditional finance.It isn’t the first time: FTX took a stake in IEX Group, the operator of a U.S.-regulated equities exchange, last month.

The convergence of traditional finance and crypto-native firms on trading platforms that allow users to buy and sell both equities and digital assets comes as trading volumes—both in stocks and cryptos—have taken a dive.

Amid the broad selloff in markets in 2022, retail traders seem to be staying put. The S&P 500 has tumbled almost 19% so far this year while the price of Bitcoin has declined closer to 40%.

This has manifested in trouble for brokers. Robinhood has announced plans to cut 9% of its staff amid a slowdown revealed in its quarterly earnings last month. Management reported a 10% fall in monthly active users on an annual basis. Robinhood stock is down 44% this year.

It has been even worse in the crypto world, where leading exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) reported a loss of $1.98 per share in the first quarter, far below the 1-cent loss forecast by Wall Street. Trading volumes at Coinbase plunged to $309 billion in the first quarter of the year, down 8% from the year prior and 44% below levels in the final period of 2021. Coinbase stock has tumbled 73% so far in 2022.

And there are reasons to believe things might get worse for Coinbase—and potentially others in the crypto world—as digital asset prices continue to slide. Coinbase didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Barron’s on whether the company was considering an expansion into stock trading.

Analysts led by Dan Dolev at Mizuho Securities wrote in a note Thursday that they estimated after a survey that the average Bitcoin holder’s cost basis is $21,000; the largest digital asset was changing hands around $30,000 on Thursday.

“If true, this means that the more Bitcoin nears such levels, the closer the average investor gets to the break-even point,” the analysts wrote. “What is the tipping point that could trigger investors to liquidate Bitcoin?” Their survey suggested the figure would be around $9,000.

Broad-based, large-scale Bitcoin sales could see a wave of retail traders leave Coinbase’s platform, hurting the company. But a note of optimism, Dolev noted, was that nearly 50% of those surveyed reported no intention to sell Bitcoin irrespective of how low it goes.

Mizuho rates Coinbase at Neutral with a price target of $60. Late Thursday afternoon, the stock was a bit below $67.

Corrections & Amplifications: FTX took a stake in IEX Group, the operator of an equities exchange, last month. An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified IEX Group as the exchange.

10,As Global Trade Gets a Reboot Heres How to Profit,2022-05-20 10:14:00,"Globalization reshaped the world economy over the past four decades, linking countries through the free flow of capital, people, and goods to bolster growth and—at least in theory—engender geopolitical harmony. Along the way, it built China into an economic powerhouse, pulled more than a billion people out of poverty, and created a burgeoning middle-class hungry for U.S. goods.

As the world grew closer, U.S. companies tapped low-cost labor abroad to create efficient global supply chains, reducing the need for warehouses filled with inventory and contributing to record profits and a free flow of cheap goods that helped keep a lid on inflation.

Much of that is now in question. U.S.-China tensions, the pandemic, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have exposed the risks of global integration. China’s ascent into a formidable economic and geopolitical rival has pushed the U.S. to increasingly view its relationship with the world’s most populous country through a national-security lens.

That has been compounded by pandemic-related disruptions. U.S. hospitals are rationing X-rays and CT scans because of shortages in chemicals, in turn caused by factory shutdowns thousands of miles away. Apple (ticker: AAPL) has warned that it could take as much as an $8 billion hit to sales in the current quarter as China’s zero-Covid policy interrupts supply chains and dents economic activity. India and Turkey are banning exports of grains and agricultural products as the war in Ukraine exacerbates food security concerns.

“For years, companies operated on the belief that periodic tensions with China or Russia wouldn’t disrupt critical supply chains covering goods, energy, metals, and minerals,” says Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “That assumption is no longer the case,”

Globalization 2.0 will take shape over years, but the early contours are already visible, with more companies and countries stressing safety and resiliency over cost and efficiency as they look to diversify and duplicate supply chains around the world.

A byproduct, at least in the short term, could be more trade as companies build up inventory as buffers. Even with the trade war, export restrictions that blacklisted some Chinese companies from U.S. technology, and supply-chain disruptions, global trade hit a record $28.5 trillion last year—13% higher than in prepandemic 2019.

In the long run, Globalization 2.0 is likely to be less lucrative for the private sector as governments direct a larger share of investments, often on national-security rather than economic grounds.

“The economic costs are going to be real,” says Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The result, he says, will be “lost opportunities,” lower returns on investment, and increased volatility.

That volatility could mean opportunity for investors in companies that are facilitating this shift by helping countries become more self-sufficient in critical areas such as semiconductors, or building production closer to home or in friendlier destinations.

Shares of many of these companies could get even cheaper in the coming months as the market digests recession concerns and the broader shifts at play. U.S. equities are baking in earnings growth for the next decade that suggests little change—even as the forces that boosted corporate profits are now challenged, says Rebecca Patterson, chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates, who sees reason for caution.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warns that the end of globalization as we know it is near—and could bring higher costs and margin pressures. Whirlpool CEO Marc Bitzer recently told analysts that the appliance giant was trying to reposition itself for a “new reality” of geopolitical tensions, freight cost inflation, and increased trade barriers as a result of the decoupling of global economies.

Big changes are ahead in areas linked to national security—including semiconductors and the rare earths critical to tomorrow’s technologies. Congress is expected to pass a China package this summer that includes money for more domestic semiconductor production and incentives to bring manufacturing of critical goods home—or at least move production to friendly countries.

China is moving to shore up its own technology and food security, as well as reduce its reliance on the dollar following the West’s sanctions on Russia. China is banning senior officials of the Communist Party and their families from holding real estate abroad or shares in companies registered abroad, The Wall Street Journal reported this past week.

Barring a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a decoupling that completely unwinds globalization is unlikely, considering the deep financial and economic ties between the U.S. and China. Exports to China represented about 858,000 U.S. jobs in 2020. More than 300 congressional districts have 1,000 or more jobs supported by those exports, according to the U.S.-China Business Council.

“The winners of this coming wave of globalization will be India and Southeast Asia. Everyone wants to invest there.” — Parag Khanna, founder of global strategic advisory firm FutureMap

The latest survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China indicated that about half of respondents delayed or decreased investments because of the latest Covid outbreak. Just 14% of businesses surveyed last year by the U.S.-China Business Council reported moving any part of their supply chain out of China. But strategists expect more new investment beyond China as companies look for regional alternatives and countries form regional blocs with like-minded nations.

Parag Khanna, founder of global strategic advisory firm FutureMap, says the U.S. is well positioned for this next wave because it is relatively self-reliant on multiple fronts. At the same time, he sees the center of gravity in trade moving east.

China accounts for 15% of global exports, nearly twice that of the U.S., and is the largest trading partner for just about every major country. China also sits at the center of the world’s largest trade bloc—the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership—which includes Japan and Indonesia, plus a dozen other countries.

Countries are hesitant to pick sides, even as the U.S. begins a campaign to bolster its Indo-Pacific alliance and form closer relationships with India and Southeast Asia.

“The winners of this coming wave of globalization will be India and Southeast Asia. Everyone wants to invest there: There’s a growing middle class and a more open society and democratic ways not found in China,” Khanna says. “They are in the sweet spot of geography, geopolitics, and demography.”

The transition to Globalization 2.0 promises to be gradual and messy, but investors can use the recent global market selloff to identify winners and recalibrate their assumptions about profits, economic growth, and returns.

Three funds and nine companies serve to illustrate the investments in the sweet spot for the upheavals to come.

India’s size, young workforce, and democratic system put it in an attractive spot as companies seek alternatives to China. India is stepping up efforts to become more competitive for manufacturers, cutting taxes and offering incentives to bolster its “Made in India” push, says Matthew Dreith, associate portfolio manager of the Wasatch Emerging Markets Select fund.

The iShares MSCI India exchange-traded fund (INDA) is a broad-based way into the action. Indian industrial companies are another, including air-compressor maker Elgi Equipments (522074.India), which is poised to take market share as companies seek alternative suppliers. It should also see increased demand as companies build duplicative supply chains around the world. Air compressors are widely used in manufacturing plants. Elgi’s valuation—50 times forward earnings—looks pricey, but Dreith says that long-depressed spending is picking up. That should boost margins, and the company’s heavy investments in Europe and U.S. should begin to pay off.

Low labor costs and an established manufacturing base should drive investment into Mexico from U.S. companies looking to bring its suppliers closer to home. While a slowdown in the U.S. could weigh on Mexico, in the longer term, the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF (EWW) offers a way to tap increased investment in the country.

Another beneficiary: Prologis Property Mexico (FIBRAPL14.Mexico), a $2.2 billion real estate investment trust that manages logistics and warehouses, and estimates that 30% of its manufacturing demand came from near-shoring last year. Increased near-shoring, along with growth in e-commerce and supply-chain disruptions, should help the company generate double-digit earnings growth for some time to come, says Matthews Emerging Markets Equity manager John Paul Lech.

Another promising area is emerging as governments look to become more self-reliant. China has laid out a road map of its priorities, with plans to generate 10% of its gross domestic product from the digital economy by 2025, making semiconductors and software critical to its goals. Sung Cho, senior manager for Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s Fundamental Equity, favors local companies like Kingdee International Software Group (268.Hong Kong) and semiconductor makers like Taiwan’s Silergy (6415.Taiwan).

The sharp selloff in Chinese stocks amid concerns about the economy and Beijing’s Covid shutdowns left these stocks trading at a 30% discount to global peers, despite similar growth rates, says Cho.

Semiconductors are the lifeblood of the global economy—a reason that China and the U.S. are intent on bolstering chip manufacturing at home. Demand for chips is also growing. Electric vehicles require double the number of chips that traditional cars do. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) sits atop the chip industry, with a more than 50% market share of global semiconductors and 95% share of 5-nanometer technology crucial to innovations in areas like artificial intelligence, 5G, and other technologies of tomorrow.

The company has been built for resilience, a byproduct of sitting in a geopolitical hot spot and managing relations with customers around the globe. It is building a $12 billion fabrication plant in Arizona and another plant in Japan, and is considering building plants in Singapore and India. At 15 times forward earnings, Taiwan Semi trades below its five-year average, as the sector is hit by concerns of a global slowdown and supply-chain disruptions.

“They are sensitive to U.S.-China tensions and changing world order and are planning around it—and are still in an extremely strong situation, which the market is unable to price properly,” says Jenny Davis, co-manager of Baillie Gifford’s International Alpha Strategy, which oversees $18.3 billion. The company’s dominance and three-year plan for $100 billion in capital spending is on a “monumental scale. No one else can compete.”

Cho favors semiconductor capital-equipment makers, which are selling at about a 25% discount to the S&P 500 index. KLA (KLAC) is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the buildout in leading-edge chip capacity. The company’s stock price has baked in recession fears but not its long-term potential.

The changing nature of global trade could also spark an industrial revolution as companies build new manufacturing hubs or turn to automation to defer the higher costs of shifting to pricier destinations. Industrials are vulnerable to fears of a global recession, but Elias Cohen, head of the international equity team at Neuberger Berman, sees the volatility as a good time to identify companies that are focused on electrical goods, robotics, and machinery, and are well positioned for the next decade.

The iShares Global Industrial ETF (EXI) is a broad-based way to tap the sector. Another beneficiary: Japan’s SMC (6273.Japan), which holds a roughly 45% global market share in pneumatic controls used in manufacturing and has strong pricing power. After selling automation-related stocks last year as valuations got too rich, Cohen has started to add some back in the recent selloff. SMC, for example, trades at 22 times forward earnings, below its five-year average.

Kennametal (KMT) is a U.S. beneficiary of Globalization 2.0 as efforts to build resilience in supply chains, especially around energy and critical minerals, increase demand for the company’s tools, dyes, and bits used in infrastructure projects and oil-and-gas exploration. It sells for 13 times forward earnings.

Charlie Bobrinskoy, who manages the focused value strategy at Ariel Investments, says the price bakes in a recession, even though he puts the recession odds at 50/50. He says the price doesn’t reflect the company’s longer-term prospects from a new phase of globalization.

Freight forwarder DSV (DSV.Denmark) does best when trade patterns change. The Danish company reported a first-quarter net profit that exceeded what it earned in all of 2019. DSV’s capital-light business model churns out cash flow, and management has a strong record of savvy capital allocation and consolidating the industry, says Baillie Gifford’s Davis. Analysts expect the company’s earnings to rise 25%, to $2.2 billion, or $9.70 a share, on top of a 81% increase last year. “The friction of change pushes customers to outsource their organization of freight transport,” says Davis.

The transition to a new type of globalization will come with its share of disruption. That boosts the case for diversification, not just for companies with their supply chains, but also for investors with their portfolios. The latest market upheaval is a good time to start.

11,Its crunch time for the push to ban Congress from trading stocks,2022-05-20 09:11:00,"A China competition bill, additional Ukraine aid, further COVID-19 funding, addressing inflation and more.

U.S. lawmakers face a big to-do list before they take their August recess and then focus primarily on November’s midterm elections, but advocates for a ban on congressional trading of individual stocks sound upbeat about lawmakers managing to deliver on that issue.

“I think there’s great momentum. It’s just not public,” said Donald Sherman, senior vice president and chief counsel for the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a watchdog group.

“My understanding is that there’s a Senate compromise bill that is going to be released relatively soon. That is a compromise insofar as it combined elements from lots of people’s bills.”

Sherman said by “soon” he means “by this time next month.”

The CREW expert also pointed to some progress in the House of Representatives, following the House Administration Committee’s April 7 hearing on possible new limits on the buying and selling of individual stocks by lawmakers. Sherman said he received “pretty robust” additional questions from that panel earlier this week after testifying at that hearing — “which suggests to me that members are in the weeds on what comprehensive legislation might look like.”

“I would think that the Senate would aim to get something across the finish line before August recess, so that then the House can resolve and pass something in the fall,” Sherman added.

“This is an issue that members of Congress are either going to run on — or run from — in November. And so I think that timeline makes sense, in order to ensure that members can go back to their districts in the fall and demonstrate that they have gotten this across the finish line.”

Around 63% of all voters favor a ban on stock trading for lawmakers, with support at 69% among Democrats and 58% among Republicans, according to a recent Morning Consult/Politico poll. But the issue doesn’t rank as urgent, as Americans are focused on inflation, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, immigration, climate change and election laws, according to a Quinnipiac University survey.

The raft of bipartisan bills aiming to stop congressional trading in individual stocks has been driven in part by reports about lawmakers who bought and sold stocks in the COVID-19 pandemic’s early days after they were privy to warnings — along with news that many lawmakers have been late with their disclosures. Other reports have raised additional questions, including a MarketWatch article in January that revealed how Congress resembled a Wall Street trading desk last year, with lawmakers and their family members making an estimated total of $355 million worth of stock trades as the market SPX, -1.10% DJIA, -0.91% soared.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat, told reporters last week that he hopes to have stock-trading legislation to vote on “this year.”

“That’s a sign that there still is some momentum there, but there’s not a desire to commit to a particular timeline,” said Jennifer Schulp, an expert from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

“I view this as one that could pretty quickly shift,” she added, meaning the timing for a vote “could very easily turn into June or July, if it if it turns into a priority.”

Schulp, the director of financial regulation studies at the Cato’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said she doesn’t support a ban on congressional trading of individual stocks, saying it wouldn’t restore trust in Congress or address other conflicts of interests.

She favors measures that would increase transparency, such as cutting the amount of time allowed between a trade and the required disclosure, or raising the penalties for not filing disclosures correctly. She also was a witness at the April 7 hearing.

While Congress is busy trying to tackle inflation, a baby-formula shortage and other matters, the push for a stock-trading ban is “not in contention with those other issues,” said Liz Hempowicz, director of public policy at the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), a watchdog that has lobbied for a ban that would cover lawmakers, their spouses and dependents.

“I think it’s all related, and the public needs to know that Congress can approach those kitchen-table issues with clear eyes and with the public interest at the front and center,” Hempowicz said. The alternative is Americans end up concerned about lawmakers handling a matter “with their own pocketbook in mind,” she said.

Public sentiment in favor of a ban helps make her “cautiously optimistic” on achieving it, added Hempowicz, who was among the witnesses on April 7 as well.

“Things are moving. It’s just behind the scenes,” she said.

Critics of a ban say it would discourage people from running for office, or it would be difficult to implement, especially with blind trusts being considered. Another argument is that U.S. lawmakers should understand what it’s like to invest in stocks given that they decide policy about the equity market.

Rep. Spanberger’s take, President Biden’s role

One House lawmaker who has co-sponsored one of the bills that would end congressional trading in individual stocks sounded somewhat discouraged in an interview this week, even as she seemed excited by Schumer’s comment about a Senate vote in 2022.

“Hopefully we’ll see them lead by example — faster than we might see action in the House, which is sad to me since we’re supposed to be the people’s House,” said Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, referring to the Senate.

“But if that’s the reality, then I look forward to them doing the right thing, and then ideally, hopefully, the House will follow suit.”

The Senate is dealing with “too many competing ideas,” but the problem in the House “is not coalescing around legislation,” she said. “The issue is House leadership doesn’t want to move this. That’s the problem in the House.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat, defended stock trading by lawmakers and their spouses in December, but then in January reversed herself to some extent, asking the House Administration Committee to look into a possible ban on congressional trading and saying: “I just don’t buy into that. But if members want to do that, I’m OK with that.”

Pelosi ranked as the eighth-biggest trader last year among Congress’s more than 500 members, with $12 million in buys and no sells. That’s according to MarketWatch’s January report, which used a Capitol Trades analysis of disclosures filed by members of Congress for their trading activity or for their family members’ buys and sells.

Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia speaks on banning stock trades for members of Congress at a news conference on April 7. She’s joined by (L-R) Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO). Getty Images

When asked what she’s doing to win over Pelosi, Spanberger said: “Getting more co-sponsors.” Her bill, introduced with Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, has attracted more than 60 co-sponsors — “quite a lot of co-sponsors for a bill that’s not imminently coming for a vote,” she said.

The Virginia Democrat decried seeing fellow lawmakers buy shares in pharmaceutical or cleaning-supply companies during the onset of the COVID pandemic, as well as buying stock in a defense company that’s “going to be producing massive amounts of specific weaponry for a war in Ukraine that we knew was coming.”

“The fact that there are members of Congress who think they’re ‘right’ to be able to buy stocks, which equates to profiting off that information, is to me just unconscionable,” Spanberger said.

“I’m continuing to build up a coalition of people who believe that this reform is necessary. But I can’t change everybody’s minds. And sadly there’s numbers behind why some people might not be inclined to support it.”

An additional hurdle could be the 50-50 Senate’s filibuster rule, in which 60 votes are required to end debate on most items, so the minority party is able to stymie the majority’s efforts. But some Republican senators have backed bills focused on congressional trading, including Tennessee’s Marsha Blackburn, Montana’s Steve Daines, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham and Missouri’s Josh Hawley.

Another watchdog group that’s pushing for a ban is planning to get President Joe Biden involved, hoping that could spark action.

“We will send a letter requesting that he push this through and basically follow his campaign promise to push for laws where Congress is not influenced by their personal financial holdings,” said Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics and general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center (CLC). That refers to a Biden campaign pledge to work with Congress to enact laws that would stop lawmakers from being influenced by those holdings.

That letter, with signatures from a range of groups, is likely to go out this week or next week, according to Payne.

The CLC expert ties passage of 2012’s STOCK Act to a strong nudge from then-President Barack Obama during a State of the Union address. That law requires disclosures of stock trades by lawmakers, and it aims to help prevent politicians from insider trading, but it’s viewed as insufficient by some watchdog groups.

“It was recognized” a decade ago that the president could deliver “a push from outside of the legislature, and that’s what needs to happen now,” Payne said.

“This problem of perceived conflicts of interest with stock trading is not going away, and it will get worse unless Congress acts right away,” he added.

12,Apple and Microsoft Stocks Rise as Rough Week for Big Tech Ends,2022-05-20 07:33:00,"Megacap technology companies Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta traded higher on Friday, recovering some of their recent losses.

The companies had seen big selloffs as market sentiment soured over the past few weeks. Faster inflation, a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike and strict Covid lockdowns in China conspired to bring the tech-heavy Nasdaq index of higher-risk stocks into a bear market. The benchmark Nasdaq 100 has lost more than $1 trillion of market value this month.

News that China on Friday unexpectedly lowered a key interest rate that is used as a benchmark for mortgages lifted stocks worldwide. The move raises hopes that the economic slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy won’t be as bad as feared.

Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.6% in premarket trading Friday, though the index remains 15% lower than it was a year ago. Apple (ticker: AAPL), the world’s most valuable company until it was overtaken by Saudi Aramco (2222.SA) a few months ago, climbed 1.4%.

Microsoft (MSFT) was up 1.7%, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) traded up 1.2%, electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) gained 2.3%, and Meta (FB), the parent company of Facebook, rose 1.4% in the pre-market.

13,The technician who called the 2020 market bottom says a shocking rally is in store,2022-05-20 07:08:00,"It’s been a terrible week in an awful year for the stock market.

Walmart WMT, -0.27% , Target TGT, +0.96% , and Tencent 700, +3.53% each reported disappointing results to add fuel to the worries about interest-rate hikes and quantitative tightening. But, Melvin Capital aside, there haven’t been signs of capitulation.

Over the last six weeks, equity redemptions have totaled $46 billion, versus $91 billion when the COVID outbreak first became apparent, according to Sean Darby, chief equity strategist at Jefferies. So you could see the argument on why markets may not have plumbed their depths.

Noted technician Tom DeMark, who called the bottom in 2020 after COVID emerged, disagrees. The founder of DeMark Analytics — known for advising hedge fund managers like Paul Tudor Jones and Steven Cohen — told Fundstrat’s head of technical strategy Mark Newton that key markets are on the verge of reversing.

DeMark’s indicators are designed for anticipating turning points, to find overextended price moves, in either direction, that reverse.

The S&P 500 SPX, -1.11% , DeMark says, will see one more sell-off, with a close below 3,863, before a “shocking rally” lifts the index between 4,400 and 4,500. The 10-year TMUBMUSD10Y, 2.782% will make one more high before peaking, and crude oil CL.1, +0.44% will make a top within four trading days — $117.29 per barrel, he forecasts — before turning lower.

The fundamental implications, if he’s correct, would be that the inflationary drivers of energy and commodities are peaking, which would put less pressure on inflation.

The buzz

Friday’s session features the expiration of key options contracts that could add volatility.

17,Cisco Stock Tumbles What to Know,2022-05-19 15:01:00,"Shares of Cisco Systems are tumbling Thursday because of the company’s disappointing financial results last night. They paint a complex picture of the current state of the tech business.

With Cisco shares down 14% on the day, the stock looks cheap. But there are challenges ahead and unresolved questions that will take time to answer.

The Key Details from Earnings

For the fiscal third quarter ended April 30, Cisco (ticker: CSCO) reported revenue of $12.8 billion, which was flat with a year ago, falling well shy of the company’s own forecast for growth in the 3% to 5% range. Thanks to better-than-expected margins, non-GAAP profits of 87 cents a share actually hit the high end of the company’s target forecast of 85 to 87 cents.

The company said two issues triggered the revenue shortfall. The first was the company’s decision to stop selling products in Russia and Belarus due to the war in Ukraine. That resulted in a $200 million hit to the top-line. Cisco noted that historically, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine combined account for 1% of its revenue. It’s an issue affecting many companies, and that factor alone likely isn’t having much impact on the stock.

The bigger issue involves Covid-19 shutdowns of manufacturing and transportation in China, particularly around Shanghai. On a more granular level, CEO Chuck Robbins said the company was unable to get enough power supply components, reducing its ability to ship finished goods to customers. While manufacturers are producing parts, logistics issues are making it impossible to get them from factories to local ports and onto ships, Robbins said. And he added that the problem is unlikely to be sorted out in the current quarter.

Sure enough, Cisco’s guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter ending in July was a huge miss. Cisco sees revenue for the quarter of between 1% and 5.5%; Wall Street had been projecting a nearly 6% increase. That comes to a top-line shortfall of $1 billion top-line.

No Change in Demand, Cisco Says

Robbins and CFO Scott Herren both insist that, aside from Ukraine situation, the April quarter issues—and those laid out for the July quarter—are 100% related to supply, and reflect no change in demand. That’s heartening, and helps explain why the stock is not down even more.

The tricky issue — and the ammunition for Cisco bears — is the fact that orders have slowed from artificially high pandemic levels.

Over the previous three quarters, Cisco has reported order growth in the 31% to 33% range—but the total fell to 8% in the April quarter. Robbins notes that order growth would have been 10% had the company not stopped doing business in Russia, in line with the year-ago quarter growth rate. Arguably, the big growth numbers from the last three quarters—33% order growth in the January quarter —had easy comparisons with year earlier quarters which were muted by the pandemic. But now Cisco faces three quarters of difficult comparisons.

Complicating the picture is that enterprise orders—business from Cisco’s largest customers—were flat in the quarter, after growing 37% in the January quarter. CFO Herren says those large orders are inherently lumpy, and he advised investors not to read that as any slowdown in demand.

But it is unsettling, and investors aren’t entirely buying the “lumpy” argument. It’s also worth noting that demand from “webscale” customers—large cloud computing players—was up more than 50% in the quarter but also below the level seen in recent quarters. Webscale orders over the last 12 months are up about 100% year over year.

“Peers are not seeing this level of disruption.”

During the Q&A section of the company’s earnings call, a few analysts noted that Cisco’s results seemed more impacted by issues in China than those from other hardware players whose quarters ended in March. Robbins said that the primary supply issues occurred in April, the start of a new quarter for many other hardware companies.

Sure enough, during Apple’s (AAPL) last earnings call in late April, CEO Tim Cook cautioned that his company’s June quarter revenue would be trimmed by $4 billion to $8 billion by Covid-related disruptions and industrywide silicon shortages. Cook specifically called out manufacturing constraints “in the Shanghai corridor.” In other words, there have been hints that the China lockdowns could ding results from other hardware companies—like Cisco.

Cisco’s comments on a shortage of power supplies are weighing heavily on both other networking equipment stocks and other hardware names more generally. Among networking companies, Arista Networks (ANET) shares are off 2% Thursday, Ciena (CIEN) is down 3%, and Juniper Networks (JNPR) is 4% lower. Arista and Juniper already posted their March quarter results, while Ciena is due to report its April quarter earnings on June 2.

Investors are now worried about other hardware stocks with off-cycle quarters, as well, including PC makers HP Inc. (HPQ), down 3% Thursday, and Dell Technologies (DELL), off 4%. Enterprise hardware and networking company HP Enterprise ( HPE ) shares are down 6%. They all report results over the next several weeks.

Apple is down 2% on the day, while IBM is off 3%. Both moves likely reflect that investors are getting more worried about overall technology spending, despite Cisco’s insistence that demand remains strong.

The declines came even as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was enjoying a rare day in positive territory.

Robbins has often referred to Cisco’s skill at managing through supply-chain issues, but some analysts wonder if the company’s current component issues are partly of its own making. Needham analyst Alex Henderson, who has a Hold rating on Cisco shares, points out that Arista recently raised guidance, and that Extreme Networks (EXTR) said at a meeting with analysts yesterday that Covid shutdowns were not affecting its outlook.

“Peers are not seeing this level of disruption,” Henderson writes of Cisco’s issues.

Jefferies analyst George Notter thinks Cisco deserves some of the blame. “We’re wondering if Cisco’s isn’t executing crisply with its supply-chain team,” he writes. “Based on our analysis, Cisco was slow to ramp Inventories and purchase commitments while other equipment vendors—such as Arista—reacted several quarters before Cisco. Hence, we’re wondering if supply chain execution is a contributing factor.” That said, he keeps his Buy rating on the stock.

A slew of Wall Street analysts trimmed their price targets for Cisco in the wake of the earnings report, and almost all of them cut their forecasts not only for this quarter, but also for the July 2023 fiscal year.

Wall Street Remains Bullish, Mostly

But multiple analysts see a buying opportunity. Cisco stock now trades for just over 11 times expected profits for fiscal 2023, an undemanding valuation that helps explains the relatively modest reaction to the company’s weak report. Cisco’s decline looks tame compared with Target’s (TGT) drop of 25% on Wednesday after its disappointing earnings report.

Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani concedes that the quarter—and the company’s supply chain execution—are “frustrating,” but he sees the issues as transitory and expects better performance ahead. Strong free cash flow and a modest valuation, he writes, makes Cisco “a name investors should stick with.”

Citi analyst Jim Suva, who points out in his research note that he is the only Wall Street analyst with a Sell rating on Cisco shares, remains cautious. Suva thinks Cisco’s long-term sales guidance for annual growth of 5% to 7% through fiscal 2025 is too high given the supply challenges, which he thinks are triggering market share losses.

Cisco shares are down 14.3% on Thursday, to $41.44. The stock is down 35% this year.

18,The SP 500 Is Almost in a Bear Market This Is the Level to Watch,2022-05-19 14:55:00,"Another day, another sea of red on investors’ screens. The S&P 500 has shed more than $7 trillion in market value since the start of 2022, and is now flirting with a bear market as defined by a 20% fall from recent highs.

The index would enter a bear market if it closes below 3837 points. It was trading around 3900 on Thursday afternoon, down about 0.5%. Another 1% loss would push the S&P 500 below that threshold.

At Thursday’s levels around 31,250, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has a bit more of a cushion. It has lost about 14% this year, and would enter a bear market if it closes below 29,440.

The Nasdaq Composite is already in a bear market—down almost 30% so far in 2022. The same is true of the Russell 2000, which is 27% below its record high set last November.

It has been a volatile decline for the market. According to Instinet’s chief market technician Frank Cappelleri, there have now been 78 daily 1% moves, either up or down, for the S&P 500 over the past 12 months. That’s up from 45 in November.

Volatility is a trademark of bear markets. Since 1970, the number of daily 1% moves has exceeded 120 in a year only three times, always during bear markets. The market isn’t there yet, but it can certainly feel like we’re moving in that direction.

The stock selloff has been most severe in the growth-oriented areas of the market. The Vanguard S&P 500 Value Index exchange-traded fund (ticker: VOOV) has lost about 9% this year, while the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index ETF (VOOG) has dropped 26%.

That includes the megacap Big Tech giants, which make up a meaningful portion of market-cap weighted indexes like the S&P 500.

Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) are all down more than the market this year. Worst off are Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla, each down more than 40%.

That has dragged on the cap-weighted index’s performance. By comparison, the equal-weighted S&P 500 is down about 14% this year.

20,Stocks Are Way Down Some Fund Managers See Bargains,2022-05-19 13:36:00,"The worry of the month is that the U.S. is headed for a recession, but several fund managers at this week’s Morningstar Investment Conference said they don’t expect a severe slowdown. They are starting to hunt for bargains in the hard-hit tech sector and among industrial companies.

Kate Moore, head of thematic strategy for BlackRock’s Global Allocation Team, said at a panel discussion in Chicago that corporate balance sheets and behavior so far don’t suggest a significant decline in economic activity. T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation manager David Giroux also isn’t too worried about a severe recession, but he says more declines are possible for technology companies that had been selling at lofty valuations without much prospect for profits in the foreseeable future. Those stocks are still expensive, he said.

Giroux is already finding opportunities in other pockets of technology that have also have been beaten up, but have more attractive fundamentals and strong cash flows, including those that can expand revenue three or four times faster than the market but are trading at lows versus the market. Companies he listed include names such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). Amazon.com (AMZN), for example, is trading for the valuation of its cloud business, Amazon Web Service, giving investors its gigantic retail and ad business free, he said.

Even if there is a recession, Giroux said, that risk is already reflected in select semiconductor stocks, industrial conglomerates, and financials given their declines of 30% or more from their highs.

Both semiconductor manufacturers and industrial conglomerates are better positioned than they often are to raise prices, also making them an attractive hedge against inflation, he said. Waste Connections (WCN.Canada) is a name he listed as a winner in terms of pricing power.

BlackRock’s Moore also sees pockets of opportunity in technology, especially software. She favors companies whose valuations are down as much as 40% from the peak but are generating plenty of free cash flow.

Not enough attention is being paid to subsectors of technology like the cloud ecosystem—cloud-computing software companies, but also consulting and others enabling cloud computing—as well as cybersecurity software, she said. Those two categories are areas where chief technology officers “would rather quit their jobs versus their spend” even as they look to cut costs in response to high inflation, she said.

The view from international managers was a little darker. Sammy Simnegar, manager of the Fidelity International Capital Appreciation, sees declining chances of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. The percent of U.S. equities trading above their 20-day moving average—a proxy for breadth, or how broadly supported the market is—is at 29%, he said.

“Narrow markets typically are prescient of an economic slowdown,” he said.

Another pocket of concern is the U.S. housing market, given that median home prices in the U.S. are up from $275,000 in 2019 to $375,000 in 2022, even as mortgage rates have risen from 3% to 5%. Simnegar sees a possible bubble—a reason, he told Barron’s, he sold out of his U.S. housing-related stocks.

More interesting lately are steady growers like Nestlé (NESN.Switzerland), Novo Nordisk (NOVO.B.Denmark) and Sika (SIKA.Switzerland) whose price-earnings ratios have fallen from the mid 30s to a more attractive high 20s, Simnegar said.

Though Moore sees opportunity in high-quality companies trading at some of their cheapest levels, she says highly negative sentiment along with geopolitical and economic uncertainty has kept BlackRock’s $21.6 billion Global Allocation Fund’s cash allocation relatively high at about a quarter.

“Sentiment is bombed out right now,” Moore said. “Generally, you want to lean in, but putting a lot more cash [in now]—we could be stuck in a trading range. I’m not bearish but I’m not in a big rush.”

Berkshire Hathaway (ticker: BRK. A, BRK. B) had roughly 911 million Apple shares on March 31 and that position is down about $30 billion since then, assuming no change in the holding. Berkshire still sitting on more than $90 billion of profits on its Apple stake. Its cost is around $34 a share.

The Apple drop accounts for the bulk of what Barron’s estimates is about $45 billion of paper losses this quarter in Berkshire’s huge equity portfolio, which stood at $390 billion on March 31.

Apple shares, which were down 1.4% to $138.86 in midday trading Thursday, are off from about $175 this quarter. Buffett added slightly to Berkshire’s holding in the first quarter, buying about 3 million shares and probably paying in the low to mid-$150s, based on a comment he made to CNBC.

Berkshire’s Class A shares were off 1.3% to $453,650; the Class B stock were down 1.5% to $302.21. Berkshire’s market value is around $665 billion.

Apple accounted for 40% of the Berkshire equity portfolio and four other stocks made up another 30%: Bank of America (BAC), American Express (AXP), Chevron (CVX), and Coca-Cola (KO).

Buffett, Berkshire’s CEO, scoffs at diversification for sophisticated investors such as himself and has said Berkshire’s eggs-in-one-basket approach has served it well over more than a half-century.

The paper losses—unless reversed by quarter’s end—would translate into the worst financial results for the company since the first three months of 2020 and a hit to book value. Berkshire lost $50 billion in the March 2020 quarter.

Under accounting rules, changes in the value of Berkshire’s equity portfolio flow through earnings—a rule that Buffett regularly says distorts financial results. The company is expected to earn about $7 billion after taxes from operations in the current period.

Barron’s estimates that Berkshire’s current book value is about $326,000 per class A share—including the projected profits in the current quarter—down about 5% from the March 31 figure of around $345,000. That means Berkshire stock trades for 1.4 times estimated book value.

Berkshire slowed its stock repurchases in the March quarter as its shares rose and handily topped the S&P 500. The company bought back $3.2 billion of stock in the period, against an average of about $7 billion a quarter in 2021. Even with the pullback, Berkshire is still up 2% this year, against a 17% decline in the S&P 500.

Buffett said at Berkshire’s annual meeting a few weeks ago that the company bought no stock in April when the Class A shares traded mostly above $500,000. Buffett has said Berkshire will be price conscious in its share repurchases.

It will be interesting to see if Berkshire has resumed its stock repurchases this month. During 2021, Berkshire favored buying its own stock rather than purchases of equity in other companies. Buffett flipped in the first quarter, buying a record $51 billion of stocks—notably Chevron and Occidental Petroleum (OXY) and slowing Berkshire’s stock buybacks.

22,Heres why more employers are dropping college degree requirements,2022-05-19 10:05:00,"Economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic has created the tightest labor market in decades. So instead of weeding candidates out, employers have had to widen their searches.

Companies have been searching for ways to create broader access to jobs in a time when a lot of employers are looking to fill them. The Burning Glass Institute, a nonprofit research center, found that in recent years not having a college degree has become less of a disqualifier for some jobs.

Nearly two out of three American workers don’t have a college degree, but according to the New York Times, 51 percent of job listings required a college degree in 2017. That share had fallen to 44 percent in 2021.

Ultimately, this comes down to how employers filter applicants in their applicant tracking systems, said Joseph Fuller, professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, who co-wrote the study. Some companies have their own software whereas others might use a service like Indeed or Monster.

By going into the system and removing that college degree filter, they opened up jobs to more people.

“The removal of these very arbitrary and binary filters just mathematically expands the people in the consideration set who are more diverse,” Fuller said on this week’s Best New Ideas in Money podcast.

Recently, a lot of big companies have promised to ease up on their college degree requirements. That includes the Business Roundtable, a nonprofit whose members are all CEOs.

Though degree inflation — when employers start requiring a 4 year college degree for jobs that didn’t require one in the past — has lessened some in the past few years, there are still substantial differences across companies.

At Apple AAPL, -1.34% , 90% of postings for the role of Software Quality Assurance engineer require a college degree, the report found. At fellow tech company IBM IBM, -1.84% ? 29%.

“When we really started focusing on this in 2016, 2017, about 80% of our U.S. job postings required a bachelor’s degree,” Kelli Jordan, IBM Career Skills and Performance director, said on the podcast. “We’re down to about 50% requiring a bachelor’s degree. So we’ve made progress. We still have some room to grow.”

IBM has removed the college degree filter from the application process for some positions — not all though. Jordan says opening up the pool of applicants for certain jobs has made the candidate pool more diverse.

The report from Harvard Business School and the Burning Glass Institute projects that over the next five years, an additional 1.4 million jobs could open to workers without college degrees.

23,Will the stock market drop 20 or 48 from the peak Heres the key factor says this strategist,2022-05-19 09:38:00,"“Is the economy under control or is it spiraling out of control? That’s the million-dollar question traders continue arguing over,” sums up CrackedMarket blogger Jani Ziedins.

Clearly, the latter argument prevailed — again — after Wall Street’s worst day in two years, and futures hinting of more pain for Thursday. Among the gloomsters, Guggenheim’s Scott Minerd warned of a possible“summer of pain” — a 45% drop from the top for the S&P 500 and 75% down for the Nasdaq.

Read: Markets haven’t acted like this since 1981 — and here’s how that played out

No doubt, Wall Street has been ratcheting stock forecasts lower in recent months. On the side of optimists, JPMorgan’s ever-stoic top equity strategist Marko Kolanovic told Bloomberg (in an interview before Wednesday) that equities will “climb out of this hole,” as recession and stagflation fears are overblown.

Indeed, our call of the day from Evercore strategists says that markets are spiraling on the view that recession is a foregone conclusion. They also say that panicky, leveraged retail investors who have been behind this selloff, should calm down soonish as the pros aren’t running scared (yet).

“On Thursday, we will get an idea whether the market action is part of a volatile bottoming process, our base case, or whether the decline could materially undercut SPX 3,854, triggering a capitulation trade,” notes the Evercore team, led by Julian Emanuel.

Offering their view of what’s been happening with this selloff, Emanuel and the team argue that markets have been caught up in Fed “misdirection,” rallying despite hawkish remarks from Chair Jerome Powell, then giving it all back a day later, echoing what happened after the early-May Fed meeting.

What’s key here is not whether markets understand the Fed’s intent, but “whether a recession in 2022-23 is avoidable in combating generationally elevated inflation, with the only experience previously being the Volcker Fed tightening (1971-81) to the point where multiple recessions were an inevitability.”

Emanuel and the team don’t think the Fed needs to precipitate a recession, but say stocks are behaving like it does.

“The distinction is critical. The last three non-Recession Bear Markets declined on average -21.3% — 2018 a ‘V’ bottom, 2011 and 1998 a ‘W’ — though none registered as an ‘official’ Bear. The last three Recession Bear Markets (2020, 2007-09, 2000-02) declined on average -47.9%,” says Evercore.

Panicky investors, notably on the retail side (they’ve been blamed before), should calm down soonish, it says.

“We continue to expect the Public (whose job prospects remain robust and

balance sheets healthy) liquidating its Margin Debt to yield to the contrary signals/Misdirection of depressed sentiment and defensive professional positioning, stabilizing stocks in the days ahead,” say the strategists.

24,10 years after Facebooks recordbreaking IPO a sense of dj vu,2022-05-19 07:20:00,"After a record-breaking initial public offering, Facebook Inc. shares plunged more than 30% in their first year before a Wall Street rise that made that freshman year seem like an anomaly.

In its first year under the new name of Meta Platforms Inc. FB, +0.34% , however, Facebook performed even worse.

On May 18, 2012, Facebook became the first U.S. company to go public at an initial valuation topping $100 billion, kicking off a wave of Silicon Valley IPOs for the then-new category of “unicorn” startups. The IPO was beset by issues, however: Nasdaq bungled the bidding process, leaving investors unsure if they had actually received the Facebook shares they wanted, and underwriting banks reportedly had to step in and buy the stock to keep it higher than the $38 IPO price.

From that day: Facebook’s IPO — success or failure?

Shares closed higher than $38 that first day, at $38.23, but plunged more than 10% the following day and failed to touch the IPO price again for more than a year. Despite raising $6.8 billion at a record-breaking valuation, the IPO was derided as “The Faceplant” while Facebook shares fell lower than $20 in their first year of trading and ended year 1 down more than 30%.

The reason for Facebook’s freshman flop centered on doubts about the company’s ability to transition from a product built for personal computers to a new era centered about smartphones, thanks to the 2007 birth of Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -1.32% iPhone. By the end of that first year as a public company, though, Facebook was getting roughly one-third of its advertising revenue from its mobile offering, and Mark Zuckerberg’s baby grew to one of the largest and most valuable tech companies in the world while swallowing Instagram and WhatsApp.

In year two, Facebook stock more than doubled, gaining 121.3%, and even as the company faced public recrimination for allowing disinformation and misinformation on its platforms and many other missteps in subsequent years, Facebook stock did not have another down year.

Until the past one. From May 18, 2021, through Tuesday, Facebook shed more than one-third of its valuation, declining 35.8%, according to Dow Jones Market Data Group. That is even worse than the percentage performance from its first year as a public company, a 31.3% decline, and much worse from a valuation perspective: While Facebook was worth $104 billion at IPO time, the decline of the past year has cost it $346.6 billion in market cap.

Much of Facebook’s current troubles, like its year-one trouble, involve Apple and its mobile ecosystem. Apple has changed its permissions for online-advertising providers that can shield more of its users’ data and activity from outside entities, which has caused problems for Facebook and other social-media companies. After Chief Financial Officer David Wehner warned that Apple’s changes could cost Facebook $10 billion in 2022 earlier this year, Facebook set a record by losing more than $200 billion in market cap in a single session.

That decline came after Facebook’s first quarterly earnings report with a new name: Meta. Zuckerberg renamed the company to focus on the “metaverse,” which he sells as a magical new online reality but is, in our reality, another name for immersive products like Roblox Corp. RBLX, -10.74% The metaverse push relies on Facebook’s 2014 acquisition of virtual-reality company Oculus, and it is expected to soon face a familiar foe in that arena: Apple.

Apple is expected to introduce its long-awaited augmented-reality hardware at some point this year, and the two sides have been gearing for another fight. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has made privacy and security his key talking points in recent years, aiming specifically at Zuckerberg, who has not shied away from a fight with the company that has bedeviled his own repeatedly over the years.

Wall Street analysts still believe in Facebook’s future. As of the 10th anniversary of its IPO, 40 of the 56 analysts tracking the stock rate it the equivalent of a “Buy,” while only one rates the stock a “Sell.” The average price target as of Wednesday was $288.51, a 48.7% premium to its going rate.

25,Three lessons from Warren Buffett worth paying attention to right now,2022-05-19 05:02:00,"This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet. The investing information provided on this page is for educational purposes only. NerdWallet does not offer advisory or brokerage services, nor does it recommend or advise investors to buy or sell particular stocks, securities or other investments.

Beginner and experienced investors are navigating an uncertain investing environment affected by inflation, war and a pandemic.

Financial clarity and strategy are in demand, as shown by the thousands of Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -1.04% shareholders who met April 30 in Omaha, Nebraska, for their annual conference or watched the live stream on CNBC.

Berkshire Hathaway’s Chairman and CEO, Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world, is a 91-year-old investor and business legend known for his strategic financial advice and prowess. Here’s what you can learn from him about inflation, index funds and value investing, and what you can do today to level up your financial portfolio.

1. Inflation is out of investors’ control

Inflation “swindles almost everybody,” Buffett reminded investors on April 30. The prices of goods and services are rising, meaning the U.S. dollar can buy less than it bought a year or two ago.

U.S. families already dealing with decades of wage stagnation now are contending with rising food, gas and shelter prices, to name a few. And while market changes and global events are out of an individual investor’s sphere of influence, it’s wise for consumers to focus on what they can control. In most cases, that means staying the course with your investing strategy — after all, as Buffett would advise, investing over the long term is typically the best way to beat inflation.

2. Index funds can provide simple, effective diversification

Buffett is a big fan of index funds, investment bundles that mirror a particular market index, such as the S&P 500: “In my view, for most people, the best thing is to do is owning the S&P 500 SPX, -1.09% index fund,” said Buffett in May 2022.

Low-cost index funds typically charge lower fees than actively managed funds and allow you to buy a diversified slice of a market or industry. In practical terms, it spreads out the risk of your investments, which is especially important during volatile times.

In contrast, “stock picking,” or actively managing a financial portfolio by buying individual stocks, can be expensive, time-consuming and risky. And according to San Francisco-based financial adviser Kevin Cheeks, it often doesn’t pay off: “Most professional money managers can’t consistently beat the market. They might have a few good years, but 70 to 80% of fund managers will underperform the stock market.”

The data proves that: S&P Dow Jones Indices reported nearly 80% of actively managed funds underperformed the S&P Composite 1500 in 2021. “Paying higher costs for something that may not perform well over time doesn’t add as much to your portfolio,” says Cheeks.

When asked about stock picking on April 30, Buffett said: “We [Buffett and Charlie Munger, Berkshire Hathaway vice chairman] haven’t the faintest idea what the stock market was gonna do when it opens on Monday. We never have.” He continued: “I don’t think we’ve ever made a decision where either one of us has either said or been thinking we should buy or sell based on what the market is going to do. Or, for that matter, on what the economy’s going to do. We don’t know.”

To get started with index funds, pick an index like the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.91% , Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.61% or Wilshire 5000 and a fund that tracks that index. Many investors select index funds by their expense ratio, or your annual fee expressed as a percentage of your investment. Then when you’re ready to buy, you can do so through an investment account such as a brokerage account or an IRA. Employer-sponsored retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, may also offer access to index funds.

3. Value investing can be a solid strategy

“Buy into a company because you want to own it, not because you want the stock to go up,” Buffett told Forbes magazine in 1974. Assessing a company’s value is one strategy for choosing where and when to invest.

Value investing means buying high-quality stocks, ideally at value prices, and holding them for years.

There’s also investing in line with your values, which involves considering your social, faith, environmental or moral beliefs when you invest.

Buffett has done pretty well for himself by following both strategies. For example, at this year’s annual conference, Buffett announced Berkshire Hathaway had purchased 15 million shares of gaming company Activision Blizzard. The acquisition is one of the more recent examples of Buffett’s strategy of picking undervalued investments at an attractive price instead of choosing stocks based on high growth potential.

In the case of Berkshire Hathaway’s beliefs, Buffett has prioritized four main areas: insurance, Apple AAPL, -1.33% , railroads (BNSF Railway) and energy. In his 2021 Letter to Shareholders, Buffett describes the railroads as “the number one artery of American commerce” and “an indispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire.” A belief in the services railroads provide and their impact on the environment are central to Buffett’s investment. “If the many essential products BNSF carries were instead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar,” he wrote.

See: Warren Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway are once again outperforming the stock market. Apple is one big reason but these other 10 stocks also helped

Even for those with $100 or $1,000 to invest, investing based on your values can still be an important consideration. Cheeks helps clients make a range of value-based choices as they invest. “Let’s focus on what you need to accomplish. And then let’s look at how we can do that through a particular lens like being impactful or charitable,” he says.

If you’re interested in value investing, you’ll need to research underpriced and overlooked companies in today’s stock market — which is easier when the market is largely down, as it recently has been.

As for investing in line with your values, many brokers have screening tools that allow you to filter index funds or other investments based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) business practices.

26,Analysis Rare double whammy hits retail investors steep slumps for both stocks and bonds,2022-05-19 15:54:57,"
NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - From meme-stock enthusiasts to retirees, this year's steep dive for both stocks and U.S. Treasury prices has upended portfolios for individual investors who had enjoyed watching their wealth grow during the historic rally in financial assets early in the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.

Wall Street's brutal tumble continued on Wednesday, with the worst one-day loss since June 2020 for the S&P 500 (.SPX). The benchmark index is now down 17.5% from its peak at the start of the year, erasing $499 billion in market value. At one point the S&P was down nearly 20% and on the cusp of confirming a bear market.

Unlike many past market selloffs, this downturn has also slammed U.S. Treasuries prices, pushing up yields, as the Federal Reserve began to reverse the easy money policies that supported the economy during pandemic lockdowns.


Growing more pessimistic, retail traders sold $87 million in equities on net in the past week up to Tuesday, versus a one-year average of $3.3 billion in net buys, according to a note from JPMorgan.

Normally, Treasuries have been considered among the world’s safest investments. But so far in 2022, the ICE BofA US Treasury Index is down 9.3%, the worst start to the year for Treasuries since 1830 according to Deutsche Bank. This has slammed investors who counted on the bond market for income and as a buffer against potential stock market losses.

""Most investors have never seen a market environment like this,"" said Christine Benz, director of personal finance at Morningstar. ""It could get worse before it gets better, and that will really test investors' patience.""

Many high-flying growth and tech stocks soared during the pandemic, and their steep decline has rattled investors who had bet on them, hoping for the kind of eye-popping rallies seen early last year in GameStop (GME.N) and other so-called meme stocks.

""What I’m seeing is the same thing everyone else is seeing who started 18-to-24 months ago, like, 'oh, look at all of the green, going up, up, up,' and then all of a sudden it’s like, 'oh crud, what is happening?'"", said Alex Rutfield, 29, an engineer in the Boston suburbs who has invested over $50,000 in stocks and ETFs that include internet and robotics firms. He said the value of his portfolio has fallen back to around even.

DOUBLE WHAMMY

The dual selloffs in stocks and bonds have been particularly difficult on individual investors who counted on a mix of stocks and bonds to blunt declines in their portfolios, with stocks ideally rising amid economic optimism and bonds strengthening during turbulent times.

That strategy does not work when stocks and bonds fall in unison. The BlackRock 60/40 Target Allocation fund, which follows a standard portfolio technique of keeping 60% of its assets in equities and 40% in fixed income to limit risk, is down nearly 12% since the start of the year, its worst performance since it launched in 2006.

The bulk of the selling in both stocks and bonds has been coming from wealthier and older investors, who are reducing their overall risk exposure, mainly through the selling of mutual funds, according to data from Vanda Research.

Bruce Bagley, 69, founder Santa Rosa Uniform & Career Apparel in Santa Rosa, California, said he has held the course so far in his portfolio, which is 55% stocks, 40% bonds, with the rest in cash, even though everything but his REIT investments have been falling.

""Where else are you going to put your money?"" he said.

Investors who had large allocations to bonds, which make up some 20% of retirement accounts on average, according to Morningstar, have canceled vacation plans, are eating in more often, and have reconsidered assistance to other family members, said Melanie Nichols, a wealth advisor at WA Asset Management in Birmingham, Alabama.

""When you have one part of a portfolio that is providing all your income and now you see it down 10% that's frightening,"" she said. ""People are not used to those returns because we don’t have those returns in the bond market very often.""

Other retirees are looking for other sources of income to try to rebuild their nest egg.

""You think you have enough to live off for years and now you don't know if it will come back,"" said one 73-year old former marketing executive in the Cleveland suburbs who had about 30% of her portfolio in bonds and said she was considering finding part-time work to help preserve her retirement savings.

""Clients who had larger allocations to bonds and who really did not want to experience volatility are feeling this, and it has been very destabilizing for those folks,"" said John Cunnison, chief investment officer at Baker Boyer in Walla Walla, Washington.

27,Melvin Capital to shut after heavy losses on meme stocks market slump,2022-05-19 00:06:00,"
May 18 (Reuters) - Melvin Capital, once one of Wall Street's most successful hedge funds which then lost billions in the meme stock saga, will shut down after it was hit again by this year's market slump.

Gabe Plotkin, widely regarded as one of the industry's best traders after posting years of double digit returns, told investors that the last 17 months have been ""an incredibly trying time.""

Plotkin had been trying to turn around the firm after being caught out in early 2021 betting against retail favorite GameStop (GME.N) and after being wrong footed again by tumbling markets this year.


""The appropriate next step is to wind down the Funds by fully liquidating the Funds' assets and accounts and returning cash to all investors,"" Plotkin wrote in a letter reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday.

Melvin Capital had $7.8 billion in assets at the end of April. The fund lost 23% in the first four months of 2022, a person familiar with the fund's finances said.

This year's losses come on the heels of steep losses in 2021 when Melvin Capital ended the year down 39%. The firm bet that shares of GameStop would tumble but was battered when retail investors took the other side and sent the stock surging.

The firm had $12.5 billion in assets at the start of 2021.

In the letter Plotkin said he had already raised a substantial amount of cash and cut the funds' exposure.

A spokesman for Plotkin declined to comment.

For a time powerful investors continued to back Melvin with Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management, where Plotkin had once worked, investing billions in emergency cash in early 2021 amid the meme stock losses.

Earlier this year, Plotkin told investors he wanted to reorganize and shrink assets to $5 billion from roughly $8.7 billion and charge them lower fees, for a time. Investors reacted strongly to the proposals and Plotkin was forced to apologize not long after, saying he had made a mistake.

On Wednesday, Plotkin said he had begun the process of liquidating the portfolio and would stop charging management fees beginning June 1. He also said that he had ""given everything"" he could but that it was not enough to ""deliver the returns you should expect.""

At the end of the first quarter Melvin's biggest investments included bets on Live Nation Entertainment (LYV.N), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT.N), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Datadog (DDOG.O). Their stock prices have fallen sharply in the last weeks, sparking speculation that a hedge fund might be trying to unwind positions.

Plotkin was a star investor at Steven A. Cohen's hedge fund which was previously called SAC Capital Advisors but left in 2014 to launch his own firm after SAC pleaded guilty to criminal insider trading charges. Melvin Capital quickly attracted attention and powerful investors and ended 2020, the year the pandemic began, with gains of 52.5%.

From 2014 to 2020, Melvin boasted average annualized returns of 30%. Between the founding and now, the fund returned an average 11.9% per year.

28,The technician who called the 2020 market bottom says a shocking rally is in store,2022-05-20 07:08:00,"It’s been a terrible week in an awful year for the stock market.

Walmart WMT, -0.24% , Target TGT, +0.99% , and Tencent 700, +3.53% each reported disappointing results to add fuel to the worries about interest-rate hikes and quantitative tightening. But, Melvin Capital aside, there haven’t been signs of capitulation.

Over the last six weeks, equity redemptions have totaled $46 billion, versus $91 billion when the COVID outbreak first became apparent, according to Sean Darby, chief equity strategist at Jefferies. So you could see the argument on why markets may not have plumbed their depths.

Noted technician Tom DeMark, who called the bottom in 2020 after COVID emerged, disagrees. The founder of DeMark Analytics — known for advising hedge fund managers like Paul Tudor Jones and Steven Cohen — told Fundstrat’s head of technical strategy Mark Newton that key markets are on the verge of reversing.

DeMark’s indicators are designed for anticipating turning points, to find overextended price moves, in either direction, that reverse.

The S&P 500 SPX, -1.08% , DeMark says, will see one more sell-off, with a close below 3,863, before a “shocking rally” lifts the index between 4,400 and 4,500. The 10-year TMUBMUSD10Y, 2.782% will make one more high before peaking, and crude oil CL.1, +0.44% will make a top within four trading days — $117.29 per barrel, he forecasts — before turning lower.

The fundamental implications, if he’s correct, would be that the inflationary drivers of energy and commodities are peaking, which would put less pressure on inflation.

29,Will the stock market drop 20 or 48 from the peak Heres the key factor says this strategist,2022-05-19 09:38:00,"“Is the economy under control or is it spiraling out of control? That’s the million-dollar question traders continue arguing over,” sums up CrackedMarket blogger Jani Ziedins.

Clearly, the latter argument prevailed — again — after Wall Street’s worst day in two years, and futures hinting of more pain for Thursday. Among the gloomsters, Guggenheim’s Scott Minerd warned of a possible“summer of pain” — a 45% drop from the top for the S&P 500 and 75% down for the Nasdaq.

Read: Markets haven’t acted like this since 1981 — and here’s how that played out

No doubt, Wall Street has been ratcheting stock forecasts lower in recent months. On the side of optimists, JPMorgan’s ever-stoic top equity strategist Marko Kolanovic told Bloomberg (in an interview before Wednesday) that equities will “climb out of this hole,” as recession and stagflation fears are overblown.

Indeed, our call of the day from Evercore strategists says that markets are spiraling on the view that recession is a foregone conclusion. They also say that panicky, leveraged retail investors who have been behind this selloff, should calm down soonish as the pros aren’t running scared (yet).

“On Thursday, we will get an idea whether the market action is part of a volatile bottoming process, our base case, or whether the decline could materially undercut SPX 3,854, triggering a capitulation trade,” notes the Evercore team, led by Julian Emanuel.

Offering their view of what’s been happening with this selloff, Emanuel and the team argue that markets have been caught up in Fed “misdirection,” rallying despite hawkish remarks from Chair Jerome Powell, then giving it all back a day later, echoing what happened after the early-May Fed meeting.

What’s key here is not whether markets understand the Fed’s intent, but “whether a recession in 2022-23 is avoidable in combating generationally elevated inflation, with the only experience previously being the Volcker Fed tightening (1971-81) to the point where multiple recessions were an inevitability.”

Emanuel and the team don’t think the Fed needs to precipitate a recession, but say stocks are behaving like it does.

“The distinction is critical. The last three non-Recession Bear Markets declined on average -21.3% — 2018 a ‘V’ bottom, 2011 and 1998 a ‘W’ — though none registered as an ‘official’ Bear. The last three Recession Bear Markets (2020, 2007-09, 2000-02) declined on average -47.9%,” says Evercore.

Panicky investors, notably on the retail side (they’ve been blamed before), should calm down soonish, it says.

30,Spinoffs Are Popular They Can Also Be Dangerous,2022-05-19 08:32:00,"Global deal making may have fallen out of fashion, but breaking companies up never seems to go out of style.

Companies including Intel (ticker: INTC), XPO Logistics (XPO), Aramark (ARMK), and Fortune Brands Home & Security (FBHS) have announced plans to spin off major divisions in recent weeks, in a bet that it will reverse a decline in share prices and boost shareholder returns. Others, such as Western Digital (WDC), have come under pressure from activist investors to hive off a business to exploit its potential value as a separately traded company. Nearly 60 global corporate spinoff deals were completed in 2021, more than the 42 in 2020, according to data from Dealogic, and at least seven more have been announced so far this year.

For investors, spinoffs—turning a division into a publicly traded company by issuing newly created stock—can unlock value. Theoretically, it allows the pieces of a corporation to trade at higher valuations than they do trapped inside the company, where they might not fit together properly. In practice, they can be complex, and in some cases, detrimental to long-term shareholder returns.

“Everyone thinks spinoffs are an easy way to make money, and they’re not,” says Jonathan Boyar, managing director of Boyar Value Group. “You have to be very careful and outline the different things to look for to see if a spinoff is attractive.”

Boyar has a point. For activist investors, spinoffs can bring substantial gains. A 2019 study by the Boyar Value Group analyzing nearly 250 spinoffs over a 10-year period found that a spinoff’s largest returns happened between seven and 12 months, reaching maximum returns of 7.1% after one year of completion. Long-term investors do less well, as returns tail off after that, with the average spinoff in Boyar’s study underperforming the S&P 500 by 2.7% a year on average. Other ways of measuring returns show similar results. The S&P U.S. IPO & Spinoff Index, for instance, has returned a 31.9% loss over the past 12 months, underperforming the S&P 500’s 1.8% loss, according to S&P Global.

Perhaps that’s why most activist investors don’t stick around that long. Funds often hold spun-off stocks for less than a year and a half before selling and moving on, said John Coffee, professor of law at Columbia University Law School. “That’s a short-term kind of strategy—to take over, do the separation, realize the gain and move on to focus the proceeds on another company,” Coffee says.

Spinoffs can go wrong in many ways. In some cases, the spinoff might be too intertwined with the parent to result in a clean cut, resulting in a process that can take years, not months. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), which announced its spinoff in November, has said that it could take up to the end of 2022 or early 2023 to execute the separation of its consumer healthcare division.

Even if a spinoff is feasible, it could be more expensive than expected, or the spun-off companies may be too small to survive on their own. Sometimes, spinoffs can fail if the parent company uses them as a way to unload debt, which could end up hurting the new company.

Oftentimes, a separation that looks good on paper can clash with the “cold, hard reality of life,” says Kai Liekefett, partner at Sidley Austin in New York who chairs the law firm’s shareholder activism practice.

That’s proved to be the case with Kyndryl (KD), the IT infrastructure services provider spun out of IBM (IBM) late last year. The company, which is still unprofitable and has yet to return capital to shareholders, has seen its market value fall to a new post-spinoff low of $10.17 this quarter. The shares are down 27.8% this year, and Wall Street doesn’t foresee any near-term catalysts that could give the stock a boost.

“Investors should watch particularly how movements of cash and debt in spinoff transactions affect the balance sheets of the two companies post-spin,” Jim Osman, founder of research firm Edge Consulting Group.

Still, that hasn’t put a damper on overall activity, with the current cycle being driven by a confluence of factors, according to bankers and industry experts. One is the Covid pandemic, which Sidley’s Liekefett says has prompted some firms to reassess their business portfolios and shed underperforming units that are dragging on profits to focus on higher-growth areas. Big Pharma has long been a big player in the spinoff game and continues to cut the cord on various divisions. Novartis (NVS) in April announced a strategic review of Sandoz, which could eventually see the generic drug division spun off. Meanwhile, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is on track to spin off its consumer business in mid-2022 to focus on its core drugs business.

Activist investors are another catalyst as they seek quicker results than corporate turnarounds that can take several years to pay off. Billionaire investor Ryan Cohen, for example, criticized Bed Bath & Beyond’s (BBBY) transformation plan, saying it “looks far better in a PowerPoint deck than it does in practice.”

The current regulatory environment in the U.S. could also be spurring companies to spin off segments they would have otherwise tried to sell, says Columbia University’s Coffee. Under the Biden administration, antitrust enforcement has increased, with regulators taking a closer look at horizontal mergers or acquisitions that would have been completed in the past.

That has fueled market speculation that Amazon.com (AMZN) could spin off its lucrative Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business. Activist investor Dan Loeb’s Third Point, which counts Amazon among its biggest holdings, has in recent months discussed with other hedge funds the rationale for spinning off AWS spinoff according to a Wall Street Journal report, which cited people familiar with the matter. A key factor is to alleviate regulators’ concerns about the company’s dominance, the WSJ said. In Third Point’s fourth-quarter letter, Loeb said the increased position reflected Third Point’s conviction that Amazon’s new management sees its long-term strategic plan as a way to move the company forward, which may include several “bold initiatives that are the subject of wide market speculation at the proverbial investor water cooler,” Loeb wrote.

Some planned spinoffs raise red flags almost immediately. GSK has said its soon-to-be spun off consumer healthcare segment, Haleon, is expected to have a net debt to adjusted core profit ratio of up to four times following the demerger, but that will be reduced to less than three times by the end of 2024, part of a pledge to maintain a “strong investment-grade balance sheet,” the company said. Analysts consider a ratio beyond four times as a point where investors often start expressing concerns.

And then there’s Bed Bath & Beyond. In March, Cohen, who founded Chewy (CHWY) before becoming chairman of GameStop (GME) and turning it into a meme stock, revealed that he owned nearly 10% of the housewares retailer. Impatient with the pace of the retailer’s turnaround, he urged Bed Bath & Beyond to spin off its Buy Buy Baby unit, saying that under the right circumstances, Baby “could be valued on a revenue multiple, like other e-commerce-focused retailers, and justify a valuation of several billion dollars.”

Just weeks later, Bed Bath & Beyond’s board announced that a four-member strategy committee would explore alternatives to unlock greater value for Buy Buy Baby as a result of an agreement with Cohen. It’s a strategy investors seem to like. Shares in Bed Bath & Beyond spiked more than 110% immediately after the announcement. Those gains have since mostly leveled off, and the stock is down 40% this year.

Cohen has a point about Bed Bath & Beyond’s turnaround. For its fiscal fourth quarter, Bed Bath & Beyond posted a loss of 92 cents a share, missing estimates for a per-share profit of 3 cents. The stock fell 4% after earnings. Bed Bath & Beyond CEO Mark Tritton told Barron’s earlier that although operational improvements were taking place, the company had not yet had enough time to complete its transformation, leaving it vulnerable to supply-chain issues.

In short, while spinoffs can create a tremendous opportunity, Boyar said, they aren’t “a tremendous opportunity in and of themselves.”

Investors, be warned.

31,Computer chip giant ASML places big bets on a tiny future,2022-05-20 19:11:56,"
VELDHOVEN, Netherlands, May 20 (Reuters) - ASML (ASML.AS), a semiconductor industry and stock market giant, has to think smaller. Or maybe bigger.

It is building machines the size of double-decker buses, weighing over 200 tonnes, in its quest to produce beams of focused light that create the microscopic circuitry on computer chips used in everything from phones and laptops to cars and AI.

The company has enjoyed a rosy decade, its shares leaping 1,000% to take its value past 200 billion euros as it swept up most of the world's business for these lithography systems.


It's now preparing to roll out a new $400 million machine for next-generation chips which it hopes will be its flagship by the late 2020s but for now remains an engineering challenge.

Executives at ASML's headquarters in the Dutch town of Veldhoven told Reuters a prototype was on track to be completed in the first half of 2023. They said the company and longtime R&D partner IMEC were setting up a test lab on the spot - a first - so top chipmakers and their suppliers can explore the machine's properties and prepare to use production models as early as 2025.

Yet, as investors expect further dominance and growth to justify ASML's valuation at 35 times 2021 earnings, there is little margin for error should the company encounter technical or supply-chain snags.

""Every check is green right now,"" said Christophe Fouquet, head of EUV programs at ASML. ""But, you know, we still have to see it all (assembled) together.""

EUV stands for extreme ultraviolet, the wavelength of light used by ASML's most advanced machines.

The fortunes of the project are also important for ASML's customers, chipmakers racing to expand production amid a global shortage. They include U.S. player Intel, South Korea's Samsung and Taiwan's TSMC, the biggest, which makes chips for the likes of Apple, AMD and Nvidia.

Industry specialist Dan Hutcheson of TechInsights, who is not involved with the ASML project, said the new technology - known as a ""High-NA"" version of EUV - could provide a significant advantage to some chipmakers.

""It's a bit like who's got the best gun,"" he said.

""So either ASML makes it happen or they don't make it happen,"" he added. ""But if they make it happen, and you don't have your orders and you miss out on this, you've immediately made yourself non-competitive.""

He said TSMC eclipsed its rivals by integrating ASML's EUV machines first in the late 2010s - a mistake Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger has vowed not to make again with High-NA.

Lithography is a key determinant of how small circuitry on a chip can get, with High-NA promising a 66% reduction. Smaller is better in chipmaking, as the more transistors you pack in the same space, the faster and more energy efficient a chip can be.

Circuitry is now approaching the atomic level, leading to predictions that the end is nigh for ""Moore's Law"", a famous 1960's observation that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years.

""If they (ASML) don't succeed it will become difficult to continue with Moore's Law,"" said Jos Versteeg, an analyst at Dutch-based bank InsingerGilissen, though he noted engineers had defied similar doubts in the past.

FIRST LIGHT ON SILICON

Since 2000, ASML has rapidly taken market share from Japanese competitors Nikon and Canon, which now mainly focus on older technology. ASML controls more than 90% of the lithography market. No competitor is attempting to build an EUV system, citing high development costs.

Shortages of ASML's machines, which cost up to $160 million each, are a bottleneck for chipmakers, who have plans to spend more than $100 billion in the coming years to build extra fabrication plants to meet demand.

The High-NA machines will be about 30% bigger than their predecessors, which themselves require three Boeing 747s to carry them in sections.

IMEC, a non-profit research group that cooperates with companies across the semiconductor industry, believes setting up the lab at ASML could save up to a year in development time.

ASML said it had five orders for pilot machines, which should be delivered in 2024, and ""more than five"" orders from five different customers for faster production models for delivery starting in 2025.

But this is no slam-dunk.

There are formidable challenges in integrating a host of complex components, including an optics system of polished, hyper-smooth curved mirrors, which are being built in a vacuum by Germany's Carl Zeiss.

Versteeg at InsingerGilissen said that while ASML enjoyed a near monopoly, its ""pricing is dependent on the productivity of the machines"". Meanwhile, it must sell EUV tools to the shrinking number of companies that make leading-edge chips, which include memory chip makers SK Hynix and Micron.

ASML is also tied to the wider fortunes of the cyclical chip industry, which some researchers expect to double past $1 trillion in annual sales this decade.

Fouquet worries most about supply-chain issues.

""Right now, and like with every other product, we see some stress in the supply chain, and this is if you ask me today, probably the biggest challenge we have with High-NA.""

Summary Companies Target Corp loses quarter of value as profit slumps

Megacap growth stocks drag down S&P 500, Nasdaq

Indexes end: S&P 500 -4.04%, Nasdaq -4.73%, Dow -3.57%

May 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Wednesday, with Target losing around a quarter of its stock market value and highlighting worries about the U.S. economy after the retailer became the latest victim of surging prices.

It was the worst one-day loss for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average since June 2020.

Target Corp's (TGT.N) first-quarter profit fell by half and the company warned of a bigger margin hit on rising fuel and freight costs. Its shares fell about 25%, losing about $25 billion in market capitalization, in their worst session since the Black Monday crash on Oct. 19, 1987. read more

""We think the developing impact on retail spending as inflation outpaces wages for even longer than people might have expected is a principal factor in causing the market sell-off today,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""Retailers are starting to reveal the impact of eroding consumer purchasing power.""

Interest-rate sensitive megacap growth stocks added to recent declines and pulled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lower. Amazon (AMZN.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) dropped close to 7%, while Apple (AAPL.O) fell 5.6%.

""The cons outweigh the pros for growth stocks at this particular moment, and the market is trying to decide how bad it's going to get,"" said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. ""The market is fearful of the next six months. We may find out that it doesn't need to be as fearful as this, and markets do tend to overreact on the downside.""

All of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and consumer staples (.SPLRCS) leading the way lower, both down more than 6%.

Rising inflation, the conflict in Ukraine, prolonged supply chain snarls, pandemic-related lockdowns in China and monetary policy tightening by central banks have weighed on financial markets recently, stoking concerns about a global economic slowdown.

Traders are pricing in 50-basis point interest rate hikes by the Fed in June and July.

Unofficially, the S&P 500 declined 4.04% to end the session at 3,923.68 points.

The Nasdaq declined 4.73% to 11,418.15 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 3.57% to 31,490.07 points.

The S&P 500's busiest trades

The S&P 500 is down about 18% so far in 2022 and the Nasdaq has fallen about 27%, hit by tumbling growth stocks. Almost two-thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs, according to Refinitiv data.

Wall Street's recent sell-off has left the S&P 500 trading at around 17 times expected earnings, its lowest PE valuation since the 2020 sell-off caused by the coronavirus pandemic, according to Refinitiv data.

S&P 500's forward PE dips below 10-year average

The CBOE volatility index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, rose to 31 points after falling for six straight sessions.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.5 billion shares, compared with a 13.4 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.52-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 37 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 242 new lows.

34,Why the looming bear market will be different,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here . You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.

London (CNN Business) When a bear market arrives, it's not pretty, especially for investors making short-term decisions. But it happens — and a recovery arrives eventually.

Quick refresher: A ""bear market"" refers to when stocks drop 20% or more from their recent peak. They're a sign of extreme negative sentiment on Wall Street and are more severe than garden-variety sell-offs.

Since World War II, the S&P 500 has experienced 17 bear markets or near bear markets, according to an analysis by LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick. Number 18 is all but certain to arrive soon.

The S&P 500 is down 18.7% from its high in early January, battered by concerns about inflation, interest rate hikes and the war in Ukraine. Most traders don't expect it to begin staging a sustained comeback for some time.

""The sour mood has been persistent,"" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote to clients earlier this week.

Historically, when the S&P 500 has entered a bear market, the average drop was almost 30% and went on for nearly a year.

That period is painful, but it doesn't last forever. And importantly, bear markets haven't always been precursors to recessions in the United States.

""In 1987, we had a bear market and no recession, and earnings continued to rise,"" Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told me. ""That may very well turn out to be the environment we're in now.""

Still, economists and investors acknowledge that the risk of a recession will rise as inflation eats into consumer spending and the Federal Reserve keeps hiking rates in a bid to combat the problem.

""The probabilities have been growing all year long,"" said Darrell Cronk, president of the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. His team now believes it's more likely than not that the United States economy shrinks later this year and in early 2023, he added.

What happens next? It's easy for every bear market to seem like the end of the world, as nervous traders anxiously eye a sea of red. But to date, every huge bust has been followed by an even bigger rally. It's just a question of when the recovery begins.

This time around, that timing is much harder to predict. Usually, a bear market bottoms out when the Fed decides its work is done and eases policy. But with inflation rising at the fastest clip in decades, the central bank has signaled that it intends to remain hawkish for some time.

""For the sake of its credibility, it has to stay the course here in terms of bringing inflation down,"" Yardeni said.

In addition to raising rates, the Fed will soon begin the process of selling the bonds it bought in recent years, another mechanism for stimulating the economy. It's never done that for very long before, which makes it harder to discern what the market response will be.

""The only time they've really done that with intent was the end of 2018 and they abruptly and quickly stopped that as growth rolled over in early 2019,"" Cronk said.

That makes it difficult to find a helpful precedent for the bear market on tap.

""There's not a lot of good models to use,"" he continued.

China is flooding its struggling economy with support

China took major steps on Friday to rescue its slumping housing market and head off a major downturn in the world's second largest economy.

The People's Bank of China cut its five-year loan prime rate — a key interest rate — by 15 basis points to 4.45%, the second reduction this year and the largest on record. Most analysts had expected a cut of five basis points, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports.

China's so-called ""LPR"" is the rate at which commercial banks lend to their best customers. It serves as the benchmark for other loans and the five-year maturity is typically used as a reference for mortgages.

The central bank's decision to slash the five-year rate is the latest in a series of steps that China has taken to tackle a real estate crisis as Covid lockdowns threaten to push the economy into its first quarterly contraction since early 2020.

Sales of new homes plunged 47% in April from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said earlier this week, while prices in 70 cities dropped for an eighth consecutive month.

Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist for ANZ Research, called the move a signal that leadership wants to backstop the struggling housing sector ""as soon as possible.""

""It also suggests that China is making great efforts to achieve its 5.5% growth target"" for 2022, he added.

Step back: The Chinese economy could shrink in the second quarter as Covid lockdowns weigh heavily on output. Consumer spending and factory production both shrank sharply last month, while unemployment surged to the highest level since the initial coronavirus outbreak in early 2020.

The property sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of China's GDP, also faces a deepening crisis.

Evergrande — one of the country's biggest developers — is undergoing a huge restructuring after it defaulted on its massive debts late last year. Analysts have long feared Evergrande's collapse could ripple across the property industry.

People are just buying sweets and booze

In the United Kingdom, inflation is at its highest level since 1982 and growth is at a standstill — a toxic economic cocktail.

But there's some good news: Brits are still shopping.

The bad news? They're spending their money on alcohol, sweets and tobacco, a sign that people are spending more time at home as their expenses rise or seeking out small, inexpensive pleasures.

Breaking it down: UK retail sales unexpectedly rose in April, the government said in data released Friday. Inflation hit a 40-year high of 9% the same month.

But dig into the data, and it's way less rosy. Yes, sales at food stores picked up — but that was driven by purchases of booze, cigarettes and treats. It's hard to argue stress eating and other indulgences reveal that consumers are thriving.

""Don't be fooled by the rebound in retail sales in April,"" Niraj Shah of Bloomberg Economics said . ""The biggest squeeze on incomes in a generation is set to further constrain consumer spending in the coming months.""

Investor insight: Concerns about the UK economy have caused the pound to collapse. The currency is down almost 8% against the US dollar year-to-date.

35,The technician who called the 2020 market bottom says a shocking rally is in store,2022-05-20 07:08:00,"It’s been a terrible week in an awful year for the stock market.

Walmart WMT, -0.21% , Target TGT, +1.02% , and Tencent 700, +3.53% each reported disappointing results to add fuel to the worries about interest-rate hikes and quantitative tightening. But, Melvin Capital aside, there haven’t been signs of capitulation.

Over the last six weeks, equity redemptions have totaled $46 billion, versus $91 billion when the COVID outbreak first became apparent, according to Sean Darby, chief equity strategist at Jefferies. So you could see the argument on why markets may not have plumbed their depths.

Noted technician Tom DeMark, who called the bottom in 2020 after COVID emerged, disagrees. The founder of DeMark Analytics — known for advising hedge fund managers like Paul Tudor Jones and Steven Cohen — told Fundstrat’s head of technical strategy Mark Newton that key markets are on the verge of reversing.

DeMark’s indicators are designed for anticipating turning points, to find overextended price moves, in either direction, that reverse.

The S&P 500 SPX, -1.08% , DeMark says, will see one more sell-off, with a close below 3,863, before a “shocking rally” lifts the index between 4,400 and 4,500. The 10-year TMUBMUSD10Y, 2.782% will make one more high before peaking, and crude oil CL.1, +0.44% will make a top within four trading days — $117.29 per barrel, he forecasts — before turning lower.

The fundamental implications, if he’s correct, would be that the inflationary drivers of energy and commodities are peaking, which would put less pressure on inflation.

The buzz

Friday’s session features the expiration of key options contracts that could add volatility.

The People’s Bank of China lowered the rate that is used for home mortgages in the country to 4.45% from 4.6%.

Ross Stores ROST, -23.00% joined the retail Armageddon by reporting a 7% drop in same-store sales. Besides flagging sales, the retailer also pointed out the impact of higher transportation and labor costs.

Chip-equipment maker Applied Materials AMAT, -5.52% reported a worse than forecast profit and gave a disappointing outlook. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks PANW, +8.42% however hiked guidance for a third time.

SpaceX paid $250,000 to settle a sexual misconduct claim against its chief executive, Elon Musk, according to a report in Business Insider. Musk, also the chief executive of Tesla TSLA, -8.71% and bidder for Twitter TWTR, +1.35% , told the publication the story was a hit piece, and later tweeted that the accusations are untrue.

Seven weeks in red

Investors are watching bitcoin’s close for this week, after the cryptocurrency posted seven consecutive weeks in losses, the first time in its 13 years of history.

A close above $32,000 “will technically be a bullish signal and could be

a sign of reversal,” according to a Monday note by Arcane research.

I’ve written more about what metrics are being watched here.

Less leverage

Compared with previous drawdowns, the forced liquidations of overleveraged bitcoin futures positions have been light, indicating a lower amount of leverage in the market, analysts at bitcoin company NYDIG wrote in a Thursday note.

“These low bitcoin futures liquidations are consistent with data we see elsewhere; leverage in bitcoin markets, often a culprit in big market moves, has been fairly benign,” the analysts wrote.

Aftermath of Terra’s collapse

After USDTerra and its sister coin Luna collapsed last week, several crypto companies and funds have disclosed information about their previous investments in the ecosystem and relevant losses.

Delphi Ventures: Venture capital firm Delphi Ventures said its Master Fund bought “a small amount of Luna” in the first quarter of 2021, which was 0.5% of the fund’s net asset value at the time, according to a Wednesday blog post. The fund has increased its exposure since then. It invested $10 million in a $1 billion Luna sale by Luna Foundation Guard in February, among other commitments, according to the post.

The fund currently sits on a large unrealized loss, the firm said in the post. At Luna’s peak price of $119.5 in April, the coin and other Terra assets made up a total of 13% of the net asset value across Delphi Ventures, according to the post. Companies or protocols related to the Terra ecosystem made up less than 5% of Delphi’s total number of deals, the firm said.

Binance: Binance previously bought 15 million Luna for $3 million, according to Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, chief executive at the crypto exchange. Such a holding now is worth about $2,400, based on Luna’s recent price at $0.00016, according to CoinDesk data. The company has never moved or sold those tokens, Zhao wrote in a tweet Monday.

Galaxy Digital: Once a backer of Luna, billionaire investor Michael Novogratz in January got a wolf-themed tattoo to show his support for the cryptocurrency.

As Luna collapsed, the ink “will be a constant reminder that venture investing requires humility,” Novogratz wrote in an open letter published Wednesday.

The principal investments team of Galaxy Digital, where Novogratz serves as a chief executive, invested in Luna in the fourth quarter of 2020 using balance sheet capital, Novogratz wrote in the letter. The firm’s treasury doesn’t use algorithmic stablecoin, he added.

The billionaire said the collapse of UST and Luna serves as a reminder that in investing, it’s important to “keep a diversified portfolio, take profits along the way, have a risk management framework, and understand that all investments happen in a macro framework.”

“Galaxy did all of these with regards to our investment in LUNA,” according to Novogratz.

The firm expects a $300 million loss in net comprehensive income this quarter as of May 11, bringing the partners’ capital to $2.2 billion, down 12% from March 31, according to a preliminary update released on May 13.

37,Cisco Stock Tumbles What to Know,2022-05-19 15:01:00,"Shares of Cisco Systems are tumbling Thursday because of the company’s disappointing financial results last night. They paint a complex picture of the current state of the tech business.

With Cisco shares down 14% on the day, the stock looks cheap. But there are challenges ahead and unresolved questions that will take time to answer.

The Key Details from Earnings

For the fiscal third quarter ended April 30, Cisco (ticker: CSCO) reported revenue of $12.8 billion, which was flat with a year ago, falling well shy of the company’s own forecast for growth in the 3% to 5% range. Thanks to better-than-expected margins, non-GAAP profits of 87 cents a share actually hit the high end of the company’s target forecast of 85 to 87 cents.

The company said two issues triggered the revenue shortfall. The first was the company’s decision to stop selling products in Russia and Belarus due to the war in Ukraine. That resulted in a $200 million hit to the top-line. Cisco noted that historically, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine combined account for 1% of its revenue. It’s an issue affecting many companies, and that factor alone likely isn’t having much impact on the stock.

The bigger issue involves Covid-19 shutdowns of manufacturing and transportation in China, particularly around Shanghai. On a more granular level, CEO Chuck Robbins said the company was unable to get enough power supply components, reducing its ability to ship finished goods to customers. While manufacturers are producing parts, logistics issues are making it impossible to get them from factories to local ports and onto ships, Robbins said. And he added that the problem is unlikely to be sorted out in the current quarter.

Sure enough, Cisco’s guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter ending in July was a huge miss. Cisco sees revenue for the quarter of between 1% and 5.5%; Wall Street had been projecting a nearly 6% increase. That comes to a top-line shortfall of $1 billion top-line.

No Change in Demand, Cisco Says

Robbins and CFO Scott Herren both insist that, aside from Ukraine situation, the April quarter issues—and those laid out for the July quarter—are 100% related to supply, and reflect no change in demand. That’s heartening, and helps explain why the stock is not down even more.

The tricky issue — and the ammunition for Cisco bears — is the fact that orders have slowed from artificially high pandemic levels.

Over the previous three quarters, Cisco has reported order growth in the 31% to 33% range—but the total fell to 8% in the April quarter. Robbins notes that order growth would have been 10% had the company not stopped doing business in Russia, in line with the year-ago quarter growth rate. Arguably, the big growth numbers from the last three quarters—33% order growth in the January quarter —had easy comparisons with year earlier quarters which were muted by the pandemic. But now Cisco faces three quarters of difficult comparisons.

Complicating the picture is that enterprise orders—business from Cisco’s largest customers—were flat in the quarter, after growing 37% in the January quarter. CFO Herren says those large orders are inherently lumpy, and he advised investors not to read that as any slowdown in demand.

But it is unsettling, and investors aren’t entirely buying the “lumpy” argument. It’s also worth noting that demand from “webscale” customers—large cloud computing players—was up more than 50% in the quarter but also below the level seen in recent quarters. Webscale orders over the last 12 months are up about 100% year over year.

“Peers are not seeing this level of disruption.”

During the Q&A section of the company’s earnings call, a few analysts noted that Cisco’s results seemed more impacted by issues in China than those from other hardware players whose quarters ended in March. Robbins said that the primary supply issues occurred in April, the start of a new quarter for many other hardware companies.

Sure enough, during Apple’s (AAPL) last earnings call in late April, CEO Tim Cook cautioned that his company’s June quarter revenue would be trimmed by $4 billion to $8 billion by Covid-related disruptions and industrywide silicon shortages. Cook specifically called out manufacturing constraints “in the Shanghai corridor.” In other words, there have been hints that the China lockdowns could ding results from other hardware companies—like Cisco.

Cisco’s comments on a shortage of power supplies are weighing heavily on both other networking equipment stocks and other hardware names more generally. Among networking companies, Arista Networks (ANET) shares are off 2% Thursday, Ciena (CIEN) is down 3%, and Juniper Networks (JNPR) is 4% lower. Arista and Juniper already posted their March quarter results, while Ciena is due to report its April quarter earnings on June 2.

Investors are now worried about other hardware stocks with off-cycle quarters, as well, including PC makers HP Inc. (HPQ), down 3% Thursday, and Dell Technologies (DELL), off 4%. Enterprise hardware and networking company HP Enterprise ( HPE ) shares are down 6%. They all report results over the next several weeks.

Apple is down 2% on the day, while IBM is off 3%. Both moves likely reflect that investors are getting more worried about overall technology spending, despite Cisco’s insistence that demand remains strong.

The declines came even as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was enjoying a rare day in positive territory.

Robbins has often referred to Cisco’s skill at managing through supply-chain issues, but some analysts wonder if the company’s current component issues are partly of its own making. Needham analyst Alex Henderson, who has a Hold rating on Cisco shares, points out that Arista recently raised guidance, and that Extreme Networks (EXTR) said at a meeting with analysts yesterday that Covid shutdowns were not affecting its outlook.

“Peers are not seeing this level of disruption,” Henderson writes of Cisco’s issues.

Jefferies analyst George Notter thinks Cisco deserves some of the blame. “We’re wondering if Cisco’s isn’t executing crisply with its supply-chain team,” he writes. “Based on our analysis, Cisco was slow to ramp Inventories and purchase commitments while other equipment vendors—such as Arista—reacted several quarters before Cisco. Hence, we’re wondering if supply chain execution is a contributing factor.” That said, he keeps his Buy rating on the stock.

A slew of Wall Street analysts trimmed their price targets for Cisco in the wake of the earnings report, and almost all of them cut their forecasts not only for this quarter, but also for the July 2023 fiscal year.

Wall Street Remains Bullish, Mostly

But multiple analysts see a buying opportunity. Cisco stock now trades for just over 11 times expected profits for fiscal 2023, an undemanding valuation that helps explains the relatively modest reaction to the company’s weak report. Cisco’s decline looks tame compared with Target’s (TGT) drop of 25% on Wednesday after its disappointing earnings report.

Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani concedes that the quarter—and the company’s supply chain execution—are “frustrating,” but he sees the issues as transitory and expects better performance ahead. Strong free cash flow and a modest valuation, he writes, makes Cisco “a name investors should stick with.”

Citi analyst Jim Suva, who points out in his research note that he is the only Wall Street analyst with a Sell rating on Cisco shares, remains cautious. Suva thinks Cisco’s long-term sales guidance for annual growth of 5% to 7% through fiscal 2025 is too high given the supply challenges, which he thinks are triggering market share losses.

Cisco shares are down 14.3% on Thursday, to $41.44. The stock is down 35% this year.

38,The SP 500 Is Almost in a Bear Market This Is the Level to Watch,2022-05-19 14:55:00,"Another day, another sea of red on investors’ screens. The S&P 500 has shed more than $7 trillion in market value since the start of 2022, and is now flirting with a bear market as defined by a 20% fall from recent highs.

The index would enter a bear market if it closes below 3837 points. It was trading around 3900 on Thursday afternoon, down about 0.5%. Another 1% loss would push the S&P 500 below that threshold.

At Thursday’s levels around 31,250, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has a bit more of a cushion. It has lost about 14% this year, and would enter a bear market if it closes below 29,440.

The Nasdaq Composite is already in a bear market—down almost 30% so far in 2022. The same is true of the Russell 2000, which is 27% below its record high set last November.

It has been a volatile decline for the market. According to Instinet’s chief market technician Frank Cappelleri, there have now been 78 daily 1% moves, either up or down, for the S&P 500 over the past 12 months. That’s up from 45 in November.

Volatility is a trademark of bear markets. Since 1970, the number of daily 1% moves has exceeded 120 in a year only three times, always during bear markets. The market isn’t there yet, but it can certainly feel like we’re moving in that direction.

The stock selloff has been most severe in the growth-oriented areas of the market. The Vanguard S&P 500 Value Index exchange-traded fund (ticker: VOOV) has lost about 9% this year, while the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index ETF (VOOG) has dropped 26%.

That includes the megacap Big Tech giants, which make up a meaningful portion of market-cap weighted indexes like the S&P 500.

Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) are all down more than the market this year. Worst off are Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla, each down more than 40%.

That has dragged on the cap-weighted index’s performance. By comparison, the equal-weighted S&P 500 is down about 14% this year.

39,Stocks Are Way Down Some Fund Managers See Bargains,2022-05-19 13:36:00,"The worry of the month is that the U.S. is headed for a recession, but several fund managers at this week’s Morningstar Investment Conference said they don’t expect a severe slowdown. They are starting to hunt for bargains in the hard-hit tech sector and among industrial companies.

Kate Moore, head of thematic strategy for BlackRock’s Global Allocation Team, said at a panel discussion in Chicago that corporate balance sheets and behavior so far don’t suggest a significant decline in economic activity. T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation manager David Giroux also isn’t too worried about a severe recession, but he says more declines are possible for technology companies that had been selling at lofty valuations without much prospect for profits in the foreseeable future. Those stocks are still expensive, he said.

Giroux is already finding opportunities in other pockets of technology that have also have been beaten up, but have more attractive fundamentals and strong cash flows, including those that can expand revenue three or four times faster than the market but are trading at lows versus the market. Companies he listed include names such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). Amazon.com (AMZN), for example, is trading for the valuation of its cloud business, Amazon Web Service, giving investors its gigantic retail and ad business free, he said.

Even if there is a recession, Giroux said, that risk is already reflected in select semiconductor stocks, industrial conglomerates, and financials given their declines of 30% or more from their highs.

Both semiconductor manufacturers and industrial conglomerates are better positioned than they often are to raise prices, also making them an attractive hedge against inflation, he said. Waste Connections (WCN.Canada) is a name he listed as a winner in terms of pricing power.

BlackRock’s Moore also sees pockets of opportunity in technology, especially software. She favors companies whose valuations are down as much as 40% from the peak but are generating plenty of free cash flow.

Not enough attention is being paid to subsectors of technology like the cloud ecosystem—cloud-computing software companies, but also consulting and others enabling cloud computing—as well as cybersecurity software, she said. Those two categories are areas where chief technology officers “would rather quit their jobs versus their spend” even as they look to cut costs in response to high inflation, she said.

The view from international managers was a little darker. Sammy Simnegar, manager of the Fidelity International Capital Appreciation, sees declining chances of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. The percent of U.S. equities trading above their 20-day moving average—a proxy for breadth, or how broadly supported the market is—is at 29%, he said.

“Narrow markets typically are prescient of an economic slowdown,” he said.

Another pocket of concern is the U.S. housing market, given that median home prices in the U.S. are up from $275,000 in 2019 to $375,000 in 2022, even as mortgage rates have risen from 3% to 5%. Simnegar sees a possible bubble—a reason, he told Barron’s, he sold out of his U.S. housing-related stocks.

More interesting lately are steady growers like Nestlé (NESN.Switzerland), Novo Nordisk (NOVO.B.Denmark) and Sika (SIKA.Switzerland) whose price-earnings ratios have fallen from the mid 30s to a more attractive high 20s, Simnegar said.

Though Moore sees opportunity in high-quality companies trading at some of their cheapest levels, she says highly negative sentiment along with geopolitical and economic uncertainty has kept BlackRock’s $21.6 billion Global Allocation Fund’s cash allocation relatively high at about a quarter.

“Sentiment is bombed out right now,” Moore said. “Generally, you want to lean in, but putting a lot more cash [in now]—we could be stuck in a trading range. I’m not bearish but I’m not in a big rush.”

41,Tesla cut from SP 500 ESG Index and Elon Musk tweets his fury,2022-05-19 16:13:27,"
In it changes, effective May 2, the sustainability index also added soon-to-be-Musk-controlled Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) while dropping Delta Air Lines and Chevron Corp, according to an announcement.

The back-and-forth over the index changes reflects a wider debate about the metrics used to judge corporate performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, a growing area of investing.


Tesla has become the most valuable auto industry company by pioneering EVs and expanding into battery storage for electric grids and solar-power systems.

Factors contributing to its departure from the index included Tesla's lack of published details related to its low carbon strategy or business conduct codes, said Margaret Dorn, S&P Dow Jones Indices' head of ESG indices for North America, in an interview.

Even though Tesla's products help cut planet-warming emissions, Dorn said, its other issues and lack of disclosures relative to industry peers should raise concerns for investors looking to judge the company across environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.

""You can't just take a company's mission statement at face value, you have to look at their practices across all those key dimensions,"" she said.

Tesla representatives did not immediately respond to questions. The company has previously called ESG methodologies ""fundamentally flawed.""

Musk tweeted that ""Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list! ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.""

Asked about the tweet, a representative for the index provider said Musk may have been referring to a list on a company blog post of the largest 10 constituents by market cap of the S&P 500 ESG Index after the removal of Tesla and others. The list is ""not a ranking of best companies by ESG score,"" the representative said.

Exxon now accounts for 1.443% of the weight of the index. Apple Inc was the largest at 9.657%.

GROWING CONCERNS

Investors concerned about issues like diversity and climate change have poured billions of dollars into funds using ESG criteria to pick stocks, prompting debate about how effectively the funds promote change or whether they push companies too much on issues that should be settled by government policy.

S&P Dow Jones Indices is majority-owned by S&P Global Inc. (SPGI.N) Musk and others have complained the firm and its rivals conflate too many issues by bundling ESG concerns into one total score.

For instance a fund based on the S&P 500 ESG Index, the SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF, received the low rating ""D"" by climate activist research group As You Sow, which noted despite its title and sustainability mandate, fossil fuel stocks make up 6.5% of fund assets.

In the company blog post reviewing changes from April 22, S&P's Dorn said the index aims to keep industries weighted the same as they are in the regular S&P 500 index ""while enhancing the overall sustainability profile of the index."" In practice that means it can keep oil companies while leaving out big players like Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB.O) and Wells Fargo & Co.(WFC.N)

Dorn said Tesla's ESG score had declined slightly from the ""22"" it received last year. At the same time the average score among other automakers improved, pushing Tesla out of the ESG index because of a rule against including lowest-quartile performers.

Dorn and others did not immediately describe other details such as the reasons Twitter or Phillips 66 were added or other companies dropped.

Among other big ESG ratings agencies, MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) gives Tesla an ""average"" ESG rating, while the Sustainalytics unit of Morningstar Inc gives Tesla a ""medium risk"" rating, according to the firms' websites.

On Wednesday a U.S. safety regulator opened a special crash investigation into a Tesla crash this month in California, among more than 30 crashes under investigation involving advanced driver assistance systems. [nL2N2XA2CY]

42,SP 500 tumbles on verge of confirming bear market,2022-05-20 18:43:15,"
Summary

Summary Companies Ross Stores plunges after cutting 2022 forecast

S&P 500 -1.97%, Nasdaq -2.61%, Dow -1.72%

May 20 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 tumbled on Friday, putting the widely followed benchmark on the verge of confirming it has been in a bear market since hitting a record high in January.

Worries about surging inflation and rising interest rates have pummeled the U.S. stock market this year, with danger signals from Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers this week adding to fears about the economy.

Wall Street opened stronger on Friday morning before turning sharply negative and adding to deep losses sustained earlier in the week.


""Any positivity is being sold in a very heavy and high-volume fashion, and that's very concerning,"" said Keith Buchanan, a portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. ""It feels like it's fear driven.""

The S&P 500 was on track to close down 19.4% from its Jan. 3 record high close. Closing down 20% from that record level would confirm it has been in a bear market since reaching that high, according to a common definition. That would be the S&P 500's second bear market since the 2020 global selloff caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier in Friday's session, the S&P 500 was down almost 21% from its January high.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) was last down 29% from its record close in November 2021.

S&P 500 bear markets

Weighing heavily on the S&P 500, Tesla (TSLA.O) dropped 9.8% after Chief Executive Elon Musk denounced as ""utterly untrue"" claims in a news report that he sexually harassed a flight attendant on a private jet in 2016. read more

Other megacap stocks also fell, with Apple down 2.7% and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) losing 3.7%.

Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors declined, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and industrials (.SPLRCI) down 3.5% and 2.4%, respectively.

Shares of Deere & Co (DE.N) tumbled about 14% after the heavy equipment maker posted downbeat quarterly revenue. read more

Recent disappointing forecasts from big retailers Walmart, Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) and Target Inc (TGT.N) have rattled market sentiment, adding to evidence that rising prices have started to hurt the purchasing power of U.S. consumers.

On Friday, Ross Stores (ROST.O) plunged over 20% after the discount apparel retailer cut its 2022 forecasts for sales and profit, while Vans brand owner VF Corp (VFC.N) gained 3.9% on strong 2023 revenue outlook.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are set for their seventh straight week of losses, their longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001.

The Dow (.DJI) is on track for its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression.

Traders are pricing in 50-basis point rate hikes by the U.S. central bank in June and July.

In afternoon trading, the S&P 500 was down 1.97% at 3,823.92 points.

The Nasdaq declined 2.61% to 11,091.22 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.72% at 30,714.43 points.

S&P 500's busiest trades

Expiration of monthly options contracts on Friday was likely to boost trading volumes and could also add to volatility, especially toward the end of the session.

About two thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.00-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.61-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and 48 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 10 new highs and 325 new lows.

43,Instant View SP 500 on pace to confirm bear market as stocks slump,2022-05-20 18:27:13,"
Stocks have been under pressure since the start of the year as investors have dumped stocks amid worries over whether the Federal Reserve will be able to tame inflation without triggering a recession, with spillover effects from the war in Ukraine and the possibility of a slowdown in China from a rise in COVID-19 cases adding to the angst.

MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: Dow down 1.35%, S&P 500 down 1.62%, Nasdaq down 2.23%

COMMENTS:

PETER TUZ, PRESIDENT, CHASE INVESTMENT COUNSEL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA

""Is it the last of it? What did Winston Churchill say about World War II? It’s probably the end of the beginning of the bear market, not the end of the bear market by itself.""

“How long it lasts will depend on when inflation breaks. The bear market will break at the same time or maybe slightly ahead of that. We have some Fed rate hikes over the next couple of months to contend with, some inflation data too. Then things will turn around.""

“What really flummoxed investors this week, myself included, is when you have the types of companies that typically do well in economic softness, do terribly, both as stocks and as companies. I'm thinking of Walmart and Target, and a few of the other companies of that ilk. These are the safe havens you run to in times of recession.""

“If the consumer is feeling bad and makes up 70% of the economy, you just have to watch out for the next few quarters.”

TOM MARTIN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GLOBALT INVESTMENTS, ATLANTA

“The most important time in the market is typically the last hour of trading. I'd rather say that if we continue to close down in that last hour, that probably doesn't bode well. But if we get a rally in the last hour with buyers stepping in, that does give some hope.”

“The market is cumulatively absorbing the information over the last week or so, particularly with the retail earnings that we've seen which has resulted in many of those stocks getting hammered.""

“Certainly, the sentiment among consumers is pretty negative. And when you relate that to investor positioning in the market, there's been a fair amount of money with exposure to the markets that we'd like to have less and hedge funds are reducing their overall exposure. They are selling what they can, they're having to cover their shorts, but clearly, the selling of longs is overwhelming any short covering.""

“So as people adjust to this, they are looking for where that bottom is, and, you know, the consensus seems to have been prior to today that we weren't there yet. Now, whether this takes us there, down to that market level of support that might be at least a temporary bottom before we could get some sort of balance is an open question. And, you know, people looking to things like the VIX which although up today is still below levels that have in the past been associated with market bottoms.”

“As bad as the markets are reacting, they haven't reacted to the extent on average that they've reacted to recessionary environments before. So there's more to go if we are indeed going to go into a recession and have an average market decline associated with that. A lot of that is going to depend on the actual path of inflation, and on what the Federal Reserve does, among other things like the war in Ukraine and the COVID policy in China etc. So there remains a high level of uncertainty. And you just don't know whether we've reached enough of a bottom that there'll be a counter trend rally.”

BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ALLSPRING GLOBAL INVESTMENTS, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN

“We have to see if we close at these levels or not, but investors are clearly afraid of a recession. Corrections are driven by fears of inflation, recession, and geopolitics. We have the trifecta going on right now. Whether we stay at these levels or go lower depends on whether the fears become reality. The reports from major retailers increase the perceived odds of a recession being realized soon, but I’m not convinced that they’re bellwethers. A little more stimulus from China or maybe a more stable inflation print on Friday from the PCE price index could help provide a floor.”

KIM FORREST, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BOKEH CAPITAL PARTNERS, PITTSBURGH

""It's a watermark but it's relatively meaningless. Can it go lower? Yes of course.""

""Hitting this mark, maintaining it and not going lower might give investors the confidence to buy.""

""Investors are all about the worst case scenario ... so all these geopolitical things could push us lower. That being said today China rate cut gave us a positive open. It is something that, if you're a longer term investor, you need to pay attention to. This is because China's rate cut might make the Fed less aggressive out to concern for a too strong dollar.""

""A higher interest rate environment calls for lower multiples. That's what we've been doing is decreasing the multiple on stocks ... if that pressure alleviates we could get back in the business of looking at businesses.""

PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, KINGSVIEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO

""If we don't today it'll be Monday. In all of the trading that's gone on in the last couple of weeks, there really hasn't been much of a bounce. Any bounce we've had has gone away quickly. So we're going to be in a bear market today if not next week. It's more inevitable than it is anything else. It's a given, certainly with what's happened to Nasdaq and small caps. It's not a surprise that the S&P finally gets there.

""I don't think investors sell because we're now in a bear market. They've been selling all along. The question is still what does the Fed do. They have historically come to the market's rescue. We're not sure where the Powell put is this time around - or if there is one... Although they've raised rates twice, we really haven't seen any impact in the economy outside of housing.""

RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, CHARLES SCHWAB, AUSTIN, TEXAS

""It does look like we are finally going to actually hit a bear market on the S&P 500 which to me is the final straw that says you are truly in a bear market, you have to close below 3,836, which we are below that level now. Now we could get one of those late-day rallies like we sometimes get so it may not happen.""

""But the one thing that doesn’t really seem to line up as far as the washout goes, or the capitulation, is just with the VIX. Thirty-two is not a low VIX, historically it is high, but it is not at all in line with what you oftentimes see when everybody throws in the towel, I am selling indiscriminately, I’m fed up, I am just trying to save what I got left kind of thinking. We just haven’t seen that.""

""Generally, you are going to need to see something above forty and sometimes it is even way above that. If you go back to the COVID bear market in early 2020 it hit like eighty so it is nothing even close to that. I believe we are going to go into a bear market, whether that happens today or early next week I am not sure, but I am not convinced we are at the bottom yet simply because of that.""

""Now it is not required you have one of those days but you oftentimes do, we could just simply go into a continued, slow, downtrend which frankly we have been in since the second day of this year. While that doesn’t hurt as much all at once, it is like pulling the band-aid off slowly, it is going to be long and slow and painful and frankly could go on for several more months so I just don’t know. But without that big, giant volatility spike and that capitulation-type feeling I am hesitant to make any predictions that we are at the bottom.""

44,Dollar gains stocks turn south on Fedinduced slowdown fears,2022-05-20 16:55:56,"
Shares had rebounded earlier in Europe and Asia after China cut a key lending benchmark to bolster its weakening economy, helping drive early gains on Wall Street.

China cut its prime rate for five-year loans, which influences mortgage prices, by 15 basis points in a reduction that was sharper than expected as authorities seek to cushion the impact of an economic slowdown. read more


U.S. Treasury yields fell for a third straight session on concerns about growth prospects. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes fell 5.6 basis points to 2.799%.

Equity valuations need to come down and the expected return on investments, the discount rate, needs to go up, said Stephen Auth, chief investment officer of equities at Federated Hermes.

""The market is starting to digest the idea that this might be a new world where the discount rate on risk assets is not zero anymore,"" Auth said.

""You're seeing all these different areas of the market get pounded at the same time and it's just been very unsettling for investors,"" he added.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) closed up a preliminary 0.73%. MSCI's gauge of stocks in 47 countries (.MIWD00000PUS) shed 0.45%, on track on track for its seventh consecutive weekly decline, its longest losing streak since the index was launched in 1990.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 1.09%, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 1.28% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 1.83%.

Fed funds futures were firmer, suggesting that the U.S. rate market has pulled back a bit from some of its more extreme rate hike estimates. The rates market has priced in a fed funds rate of 2.783% at the end of next year, compared with a current level of 0.83%. The rate was as high as 2.9% two weeks ago.

The dollar recouped some of its recent losses against the euro but remained on pace for its worst weekly loss against the common currency since early February as investors questioned whether the greenback's month-long rally was done.

The dollar has been supported in recent months by a flight to safety amid a rout across markets due to fears of soaring inflation, a hawkish Fed and the war in Ukraine.

The dollar index rose 0.136%, with the euro down 0.29% to $1.0555. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.01% to 127.78 per dollar.

Euro zone bond yields were higher after two days of hefty falls as risk sentiment improved following China's rate cut.

Germany's 10-year government bond yield fell 1.2 basis points to 0.932%, well below last week's eight-year high of 1.189%.

Markets are pricing in 38 basis points of tightening from the European Central Bank by its July meeting . This suggests a 25 basis point hike is fully priced in and markets see around a 50/50 chance of an additional 25 basis point move. read more

Oil prices steadied, on course for little change for the week as a planned European Union ban on Russian oil balanced concerns that slowing economic growth will hurt demand.

U.S. crude rose 0.08% to $112.30 per barrel and Brent was at $111.64, down 0.36% on the day.

Gold eased 0.1% to $1,840.71 an ounce as the dollar, in which bullion is priced, rebounded from two-week lows. But the safe-haven metal was still likely to post its first weekly gain in five.

45,Take Five Surging inflation recession risk and tanking markets,2022-05-20 09:18:35,"
Meeting minutes from the world's foremost policy makers may shed some light, while New Zealand and South Korean central banks ponder how big their rate hikes need to be to keep up with the Fed. And Washington holds the key to a Russian sovereign default as a key deadline approaches.

Here's your look at the week ahead from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo and Dhara Ranasinghe, Saikat Chatterjee and Karin Strohecker in London.


1/ FED THINKING

Can the Federal Reserve tame the worst U.S. inflation in decades without dragging the economy into a recession? The bank's meeting minutes on May 25 will offer clues.

Chair Jerome Powell is confident the Fed can achieve a ""soft landing"" -- words that are little solace to equity markets as recession warnings from big Wall Street banks pile up. Having raised rates by 75 basis points since March, the Fed is expected to hike another 50 bps in July. read more

Powell has vowed to raise rates as high as needed to tame inflation. The minutes will show how tenacious policy makers expect inflation to be and whether growth is resilient enough to face much tighter monetary policy. read more

2/ A BEAR HUG

Wall Street is melting. Major stock market indexes are in the grip of bear market territory with S&P 500 (.SPX) down some 19%, the high flying Nasdaq has lost more than a quarter from a November 2021 peak. And there's no respite in sight: Barclays and Goldman predict further pain for equities as corporate margins suffer from surging inflation. read more

The selloff is widespread. Since the bond bull market peak in March 2020, a constant duration 30-year U.S. Treasury bond lost half its value, safe-haven gold is down 6% this quarter. Surging volatility means even hardened stock pickers are reluctant to take big bets. read more

Retail and institutional investors are also bearish. A U.S. retail investment sentiment index is close to a March 2009 low while fund managers are running their highest cash levels since September 2011. read more

AAII

3/ PIVOT POINT

Forward-looking Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data from the United States, Australia, Britain, Japan and euro area is worth paying attention to. And more so than usual with central banks caught between surging inflation and its impact on consumers amid a darkening growth outlook, hurt by China's COVID-lockdowns and war in Ukraine.

China bounced back quickly from an initial 2020 pandemic slump thanks to bumper exports and factory production, but the current downturn could be harder to shake off. read more

Entrenched in their inflation fight, policymakers may reach a pivot point in coming months where they have little choice but to focus on recession risk. PMIs have held up well recently, but might show how close that turning point is. read more

Global PMIs above 50 but for how long?

4/ EARLY MOVERS CATCHING UP

They were early movers, but the race is on for central banks in New Zealand and Korea to stay ahead of a Fed hot on their heels with some big-step hikes. read more

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is widely seen raising rates by a half point again on Wednesday to tame inflation though risks to the economy are rising with recent homebuyers feeling the pain of higher mortgage rates. read more

Korea's new central bank governor roiled markets by flagging a half point increase before his maiden meeting on Thursday. Falling behind the curve could squeeze the fragile won, sending imported food and energy prices soaring. read more

One of the few remaining holdouts, Bank Indonesia, is tipped to stay put a little longer when meeting on Tuesday.

5/ RUSSIA FACES DEFAULT, AGAIN

The prospect of a Russian sovereign default is back given a deadline for a U.S. license allowing Moscow to make payments expiring on May 25 and $100 million in interest payments due a couple of days after. read more

Russia's $40 billion of sovereign bonds are just one of the flashpoints after its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 sparked sweeping sanctions and counter measures from Moscow.

Also pressing, is whether gas will keep flowing to Europe as firms struggle to confirm how they can legally buy gas if they have to pay in roubles with payments due from May 20. The EU has advised companies against opening rouble accounts but stopped short of saying that this would breach its sanctions against Moscow. Russia supplies around 40% of the EU's gas. read more

Summary Companies Cisco tumbles on full-year growth forecast cut

Canada Goose jumps after upbeat profit outlook

S&P 500 -0.58%, Nasdaq -0.26%, Dow -0.75%

May 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower after a volatile session on Thursday, with Cisco Systems slumping after giving a dismal outlook, while investors fretted about inflation and rising interest rates.

Shares of Cisco (CSCO.O) slumped 13.7% after the networking gear maker lowered its 2022 revenue growth outlook, taking a hit from its Russia exit and component shortages related to COVID-19 lockdowns in China. read more

Apple (AAPL.O) and chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) declined 2.5% and 4.3%, respectively, and weighed on the S&P 500.


""The reality is that inflation is running hot and interest rates are rising,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, Minnesota. ""Until you get that inflation rate to start slowing, we're going to have increased volatility, and in our view that continues through throughout most of the summer months.""

Twitter (TWTR.N) climbed 1.2% after Bloomberg reported that company executives told staff that Elon Musk's $44-billion deal was proceeding as expected and they would not renegotiate the price. read more

The S&P consumer staples index (.SPLRCS) fell 2% to its lowest level since December as retail firms face the brunt of rising prices hurting the purchasing power of U.S. consumers.

Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) became the latest retailer to flag a hit from four-decades high inflation as the department store chain cut its full-year profit forecast. read more

Its shares, however, rebounded over 4% after slumping 11% in the previous session due to dismal results from Target Corp (TGT.N).

The S&P 500 is down about 18% from its record close on Jan. 3 as investors adjust to strong inflation, geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine and tightening financial conditions with the U.S. Federal Reserve raising rates.

A close of 20% or more below its January record high would confirm the S&P 500 has been in a bear market since hitting that peak, according to a widely used definition.

48,Two major banks expect more pain for US equities,2022-05-19 08:13:51,"
LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Two major banks expect more pain for the U.S. stock markets after benchmark indexes posted on Wednesday their worst one-day losses in two years.

In a report published on Thursday, Barclays strategists said margins for U.S. companies and their forward earnings were under pressure due to a combination of factors, ranging from severity of China's COVID lockdowns to the war in Ukraine and the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish stance.

""Given the numerous negative near-term catalysts for the SPX we believe that the risks remain firmly stacked to the downside,"" they said in a note, referring to the S&P 500 (.SPX).


A key drag on the index had been underwhelming results posted in the current earnings season by the high-flying FAANG group - Meta Platforms (FB.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) - Barclays said. The weak results had been the largest negative contribution to the broader index in seven years.

Moreover, fiscal stimulus unleashed during the pandemic had resulted in record consumption of goods as consumers spent during lockdowns, Barclays said. This had translated into strong corporate earnings in the past two years.

Now that consumer spending was switching to services, support for earnings would not be so strong.

Separately, Goldman Sachs strategists estimated a 35% probability of the U.S. economy entering a recession in the next two years.

Furthermore, investors' behaviour in the U.S. stock market, rotating out of some categories of shares and into others, suggested they were pricing in even greater odds of a downturn.

The S&P 500 is down more than 18% so far in 2022 and the Nasdaq has fallen about 27%, dragged lower by tumbling growth stocks. Almost two-thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs, according to Refinitiv data.

Goldman Sachs said that in 12 recessions since World War Two, U.S. stocks had fallen from peak to trough by a median of 24%.

A decline of that magnitude from the January peak would take stocks 11% below current market levels. An average drop from the peak would be 18%.

Dividend futures represented a second market indicator pricing an outcome consistent with recession, the U.S. investment bank's strategists said. Dividend futures implied S&P 500 dividends would fall by nearly 5% in 2023.

In the past 60 years, trailing four-quarter S&P 500 dividends had never fallen on an annual basis outside of a recession, Goldman Sachs said.

Even retail investors, typically contrarian in recent market selloff episodes, are selling, according to data.

Intra-week selling by retail traders was the worst since March 2020, according to JP Morgan. Charles Schwab net assets suffered outflows for the first time since 2020.

Summary Companies Target Corp loses quarter of value as profit slumps

Megacap growth stocks drag down S&P 500, Nasdaq

Indexes end: S&P 500 -4.04%, Nasdaq -4.73%, Dow -3.57%

May 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Wednesday, with Target losing around a quarter of its stock market value and highlighting worries about the U.S. economy after the retailer became the latest victim of surging prices.

It was the worst one-day loss for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average since June 2020.

Target Corp's (TGT.N) first-quarter profit fell by half and the company warned of a bigger margin hit on rising fuel and freight costs. Its shares fell about 25%, losing about $25 billion in market capitalization, in their worst session since the Black Monday crash on Oct. 19, 1987. read more

""Retailers are starting to reveal the impact of eroding consumer purchasing power.""

Interest-rate sensitive megacap growth stocks added to recent declines and pulled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lower. Amazon (AMZN.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) dropped close to 7%, while Apple (AAPL.O) fell 5.6%.

""The cons outweigh the pros for growth stocks at this particular moment, and the market is trying to decide how bad it's going to get,"" said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. ""The market is fearful of the next six months. We may find out that it doesn't need to be as fearful as this, and markets do tend to overreact on the downside.""

All of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and consumer staples (.SPLRCS) leading the way lower, both down more than 6%.

Rising inflation, the conflict in Ukraine, prolonged supply chain snarls, pandemic-related lockdowns in China and monetary policy tightening by central banks have weighed on financial markets recently, stoking concerns about a global economic slowdown.

Traders are pricing in 50-basis point interest rate hikes by the Fed in June and July.

Unofficially, the S&P 500 declined 4.04% to end the session at 3,923.68 points.

The Nasdaq declined 4.73% to 11,418.15 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 3.57% to 31,490.07 points.

The S&P 500 is down about 18% so far in 2022 and the Nasdaq has fallen about 27%, hit by tumbling growth stocks. Almost two-thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs, according to Refinitiv data.

Wall Street's recent sell-off has left the S&P 500 trading at around 17 times expected earnings, its lowest PE valuation since the 2020 sell-off caused by the coronavirus pandemic, according to Refinitiv data.

S&P 500's forward PE dips below 10-year average

The CBOE volatility index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, rose to 31 points after falling for six straight sessions.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.52-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 37 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 242 new lows.

50,Robinhood investors are going to get their heads handed to them as bear market takes hold says Godfather of chart analysis,2022-05-20 14:56:00,"A bear market for the S&P 500? The stage certainly appears to be set for one, as equity benchmarks added to ugly weekly declines on Friday.

Prominent market technician Ralph Acampora told MarketWatch that stocks may still be looking at “another 10% or 15% to come on the downside,” as a protracted period of lofty valuations comes unbound.

“I think there’s so much confusion out there,” Acampora, a pioneer in the field of chart-based trading, told MarketWatch, in an interview on Friday afternoon. He speculated that the point of capitulation for most investors still hadn’t been achieved in stocks, based on his analysis.

“I think it could come in the next couple of months, though,” he said. The market technician said he wanted to see a more pronounced move in the Cboe Volatility Index VIX, +4.87% , aka VIX, with, perhaps, a one-day jump of around 50% seen as a meaningfully indicator, in his view.

The VIX itself, which uses S&P 500 options to measure trader expectations for volatility over the coming 30-day period, stood at around 32 on Friday. The index tends to rise as stocks fall and is often therefore referred to as a guide to the level of investor fear. Its historical average ranges between 19 and 20 and it was up 10% so far this week and 84% in the year to date.

Check out: How long does the average bear market last? Selloff leaves Dow, S&P 500 near threshold.

Stocks, meanwhile, have been convulsing lower.

Friday’s slump comes after the indexes opened higher on the session and after the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.89% and S&P 500 booked their lowest closes since March 2021 on Thursday, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Acampora sees the current environment, with the Federal Reserve raising rates in the face of a surge in inflation, as leading to the end of the long-term bullish phase of stocks, with retail investors crowding into popular technology and meme-related trades.

“I think the Robinhoods, they’re going to get their heads handed to them,” said Acampora.

“And that will be a good lesson to them in investing,” he said, referring to trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD, -2.99% , popular among a younger set of retail investors.

Indeed, the S&P 500 has been on the precipice of a decline into bear-market territory, with a close below 3,837.25 marking the 20% pullback from the benchmark’s recent high, which would meet the widely accepted criteria for a bear market.

The Dow, meanwhile, was 16.5% below its Jan. 4 record finish, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.59% was already in bear-market territory and extended its tumble.

It isn’t all gloom for Acampora, he says that after markets eventually “wash out,” and the remaining bulls throw in their towels, he is anticipating that a rebound will take hold.

“It’s not the end of the world,” he said.

One factor that gives the analyst pause in his timing is the growing number of bears, which he says could be contraindicative, suggesting the possibility of a burst higher sooner for stocks.

“Everybody’s negative and I don’t like being a part of the crowd,” he said. “But sometimes the crowds are right.”

51,SP 500 drops into bear market territory as recession fears mount,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business)The S&P 500 fell into bear market territory Friday, slipping more than 20% from its record high and potentially ending the bull run that began in March 2020. 
The designation comes on the heels of six straight weekly losses for the index and follows months of precipitous market drops. The S&P 500 has long been considered the most accurate measure of the nation's stock performance.  
In the three years prior to this bear market, the index grew by 90%.
Downward momentum pushed the S&P 500 further in afternoon trading, down more than 2% for the day and 20.3% from its record-high close of 4,796.46 in early January. 
The index's slide highlights investors' increasingly dark economic outlook—one fueled by slowing economic and earnings growth, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve's subsequent monetary tightening. 
These conditions will likely continue until there's enough economic data to prove that inflation is cooling, said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. ""I don't think we're at quite peak freakout yet,"" she said. ""It might not be enough just to cross over into bear territory."" 
Young sees a slow burn ahead. ""I think we might have to stay [in a bear market] for a little while. I don't know that we're going to bounce back out of it very quickly.""
Friday's drop is also a bad omen for the economy as a whole. Only one bear market in the last 50 years, the market crash of 1987, was not accompanied by a recession. 
""For the majority of the bull market since the March 2020 low, investors have had reasons to buy the dips; and given this slowdown is looking more 'natural' and protracted, there is a heightened degree of fear and not knowing where to hide,"" wrote Charles Schwab analyst Kevin Gordon in a note. ""I don't think that discomfort leaves us anytime soon, especially given the fact that monetary and fiscal policy are no longer at investors' backs.""

There is a saying among market analysts that the Fed tends to tighten policy until something breaks, and many analysts believe that this downturn will continue on until the Fed finishes its current round of interest rate hikes. 
""With Federal Reserve policy still poised to accelerate the pace of tightening, with balance-sheet reduction entering the mix and inflation proving somewhat stubborn, investors are shifting their gaze toward potential for a growth scare if not an outright recession,"" wrote Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a note Monday. 
Morgan Stanley predicts a 27% chance of recession in the next 12 months, a probability that jumped from just 5% in March. 
Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile, doesn't foresee market cataclysm once the bear market officially begins. ""Volatility has been up a little bit, that has some effect on liquidity in some markets,"" he said during a Wall Street Journal interview Tuesday. ""Nonetheless, the markets are orderly, they are functioning."" 
There have been 17 S&P 500 bear markets (or near bear markets) since World War II with an average drop of nearly 30% and a duration of about a year, according to an analysis by LPL Research. 
The S&P 500 joins the Nasdaq Composite, which has lost more than 30% this year, in bear territory. The Dow, meanwhile, has fallen more than 5,900 points, or nearly 16%, this year.

52,The dip is your friend Why some advisers are telling young investors to buy stocks despite stagflation fears roiling markets,2022-05-20 14:17:00,"How low can stocks go? This question has made investors nervous, as they fear one bottom after another.

The answer: Pick a number. Some analysts say brace for further drops, others expect a bounce.

Wall Street is nervous at the prospect of stagflation — the double-edged sword of prolonged inflation and high unemployment — as the Federal Reserve attempts to combat inflation by raising interest rates without pushing the economy into recession.

Anh Tran, managing partner at Orange, Calif.-based SageMint Wealth, has some advice for young investors who have time before they retire: “These are the times that we should take advantage of the market’s volatility and continue to invest.”

She was speaking at CNBC’s “Own Your Money Before it Owns You” event on Thursday.

Why? Generation Z and millennial investors have 25 to 30 years or so recover from another bottom.

“A dip is your best friend, so buy the dip, take advantage of the fact that prices are low right now and don’t try to time the market,” added Paula Pant, host of the podcast “Afford Anything,” also at the event.

“‘These are the times that we should take advantage of the market’s volatility and continue to invest.’” — Anh Tran of SageMint Wealth

Buying the dip or “BTD” is not always as simple or smart a move as it might appear, as Jon Burckett-St. Laurent, a senior portfolio manager at Exencial Wealth Advisors, wrote on MarketWatch in April.

With CPI hovering at 40-year highs — hitting 8.3% in April — he said central banks may not be so eager to intervene with aggressive rate cuts or keep extra money flowing with bond purchases via so-called “quantitative easing,” especially in the event that economic growth slows significantly.

“The next problem with BTD is that a realistic strategy requires more details than ‘buy when the price falls,’” he wrote. “Some questions to consider: What constitutes a dip? What money are we using to buy? When do we sell?”

Instead, Burckett-St. Laurent recommends what he calls a “tactical rebalance” to, for example, 80% stocks and 20% bonds and, once the market has recovered and fundamentals look more secure, move back to 60% stocks and 40% bonds.

He also suggests waiting for blood on the streets. “If stocks are down 50%, it may constitute a sentiment-driven overreaction,” he added. A decline of 3%, 5% or even10%, is not exactly a “generational buying opportunity,” he added.

“‘Some questions to consider: What constitutes a dip? What money are we using to buy? When do we sell?’” — Jon Burckett-St. Laurent, a senior portfolio manager at Exencial Wealth Advisors

Still, a recent survey by personal-finance site Bankrate shows 43% of investors ages 18 to 25 said they’re ready to increase their investments. More than a quarter, 27%, were millennials ages 26 to 41.

But only14% of investors ages 41 to 57, the so-called Gen X demographic. And just 8% of baby boomers, ages 58 to 76, said they were likely to invest more in the market this year. Some 22% said they’d be investing less.

Even those younger investors may be less confident now about buying the dip. The new survey was fielded a month ago — before Wednesday’s stock-market rout in the face of inflation jitters.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.89% , the S&P 500 SPX, -1.07% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.59% all slid into the red again on Friday, after briefly holding onto positive territory earlier in the day.

The Dow and S&P 500 closed Thursday at their lowest since March 2021. The Dow is on track for a 2.3% weekly fall, which would be its eighth straight and the longest since 1932, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

53,Cheer Up Even a Bear Market Has a Silver Lining,2022-05-20 14:16:00,"Rising interest rates, sky-high inflation, lackluster economic growth, pressure on corporate profit margins: It isn’t hard to come up with reasons to be bearish on the stock market right now—or see the S&P 500 down 20% and be full of doom and gloom.

But there are reasons to be optimistic, too. As the S&P 500 officially enters a bear market and wraps up its seventh straight week of losses, now seems like a good time to bring them up.

For starters, a recession isn’t a done deal. Sky-high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish moves to bring it down, plus the long-running supply chain and Covid-19 drags on growth, are the best known forces that risk tipping the U.S. and global economies into contraction. On the other hand, Americans have significant savings from the past two years that could help cushion the blow of those rising prices, and an ultra-strong job market is another positive for households. And while interest rates are certainly going up, they remain low by historical standards and won’t rise above neutral for some time.

“U.S. economic surprises remain in positive territory,” wrote RBC Capital Markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina. “High frequency economic indicators like dining, flying, back to work, and same store sales remain stable. Freight rates have come down sharply from their highs. Inflation expectations are retreating.”

That hasn’t stopped stocks from largely pricing in a recession since the start of the year. The S&P 500 was down 1.5% on Friday afternoon, stretching its loss to more than 20% from the index’s Jan. 3 record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 15%, and the Nasdaq Composite has tumbled 30%.

“Historically, the S&P 500 has fallen an average of 29% around recession (median of 24%),” wrote Truist co-CIO Keith Lerner on Friday. “With the S&P 500 currently showing a peak-to-trough decline of almost 19%, the market is effectively already pricing in a 60%-75% chance of recession based on the average and median.”

That means typical downside of another 7% to 13% if a recession does in fact arrive, according to Lerner. If it doesn’t, there’s a rally on its way.

“When equity market odds of recession have moved to current levels, 12-month forward returns have been binary,” wrote Keith Parker, head of U.S. equity strategy at UBS, earlier this week. “The S&P 500 fell by -9% on average when a recession materialized but rallied +12% if it did not.”

The entirety of the correction this year has been in the market’s valuation multiple, with analysts not pricing an earnings recession into their models. That could be a miscalculation, and suggest that estimates will have to decline. Or it could mean that the individual-company view is rosier than the macro picture.

“At face value, this year’s decline in the S&P 500 looks a bit unusual,” ​​wrote Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics. “Previous large falls, such as in 2007-09 and 2020, have often come alongside big downward revisions to earnings expectations …By contrast, aggregate earnings forecasts for S&P 500 companies have been revised up this year, even as stock prices have tumbled.”

The S&P 500 now trades for less than 17 times its expected earnings over the next four quarters, down from nearly 22 times at the beginning of the year. The multiple is elevated due to the pricey Big Tech stocks at the top of the index, which is weighted by market value. The equal-weight S&P 500, meanwhile, trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just over 14 times.

The optimist’s view is that’s a reasonable valuation that sets the market up for a potential rebound. Measures of investor sentiment, fund flows, and positioning have become significantly more bearish and negative as the market has sold off. Those contrarian indicators historically have been followed by rebounds. The past seven weeks have been painful, but the upshot is a much more attractive starting point for stock investors today.

The entry into a bear market has been the pivot point in the past. The S&P 500 has been higher one month later 83% of the time since 1950, according to Dow Jones Market Data, with an average gain of 3.7%. And a year after entering a bear market, returns have been positive 75% of the time—averaging 17%.

“Equities stand to recover if a recession doesn’t come through, given already substantial multiple de-rating, reduced positioning, and downbeat sentiment,” wrote Marko Kolanovic, J.P. Morgan’s chief global markets strategist.

It’s impossible to call a trough in real time, and a near-term bounce may be followed by further declines. But it isn’t all bad out there. And with stocks pricing in a near worst-case scenario, it wouldn’t take a lot of good news to get the market rising again.

54,Watch out if youre male over 45 and think you know about investing,2022-05-20 14:15:00,"The stock market’s recent weakness could be particularly hazardous to your wealth if you’re male, above the age of 45, married, have more dependents, or think you have excellent investment knowledge.

That’s because investors in these demographic categories are more likely to react to the market’s decline by freaking out and “panic selling.” And if you do that, odds are good that you won’t get back into equities until the stock market is much higher than where it stood when you sold—causing you to lose out to buying and holding.

In fact, according to a new study, you might never get back in. Nearly a third of investors who “panic sell” swear off equities altogether, and never re-enter the market. So they lose out on stocks’ long-term potential.

This new study would be important to review at any time, but especially now, given the stock market’s recent losses. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.92% has fallen 16% just since late March, while the Nasdaq Composite has fallen 22% COMP, -1.43% . Both declines are unusually severe for such a short period of time, causing many retirees and near-retirees to panic.

Read: You just retired and your target-date fund has plunged. What do you do now?

This new study appears in the Winter 2022 issue of the Journal of Financial Data Science. Entitled “When Do Investors Freak Out? Machine Learning Predictions of Panic Selling,” the study was conducted by a number of researchers at MIT’s Laboratory for Financial Engineering. Panic selling occurs when an investor “intentionally sells off a substantial portion of his risky assets abruptly,” and the researchers specifically define it as “a decline of 90% of a household’s equity assets over the course of one month, of which 50% or more is due to trades.”

For the study, the authors were given access to a data set consisting of more than 650,000 individual brokerage accounts between 2003 and 2015. The data set contained substantial details for many of the account owners, allowing the researchers to correlate the frequency of panic selling with various demographic variables. They found the following variables to be correlated with such frequency:

Age. People older than 45 have a “heighten tendency to make panic sales… Younger investors are less likely to make panic sales by a wide margin.”

People older than 45 have a “heighten tendency to make panic sales… Younger investors are less likely to make panic sales by a wide margin.” Marital status. “Investors who are married or divorced are more likely than other groups to freak out.”

“Investors who are married or divorced are more likely than other groups to freak out.” Gender. “Males are slightly more likely than females to… panic sell during periods of high financial stress.”

“Males are slightly more likely than females to… panic sell during periods of high financial stress.” Number of dependents. “Investors with no dependents are least likely to panic sell.”

“Investors with no dependents are least likely to panic sell.” Self-declared investing experience . “The likelihood of panic sales and freak-outs is most pronounced when the investor has self-declared good or excellent investing experience.”

. “The likelihood of panic sales and freak-outs is most pronounced when the investor has self-declared good or excellent investing experience.” Self-declared investing knowledge. “Similar to investing experience, we find that investors who describe their investment knowledge as good or excellent panic sell or freak out in higher proportions.”

Why are these demographic characteristics correlated with an increased predisposition to panic selling? That’s difficult to answer, since correlation is not causation. The researchers don’t attempt an answer.

But no doubt many different factors interact to cause these results. If I were to speculate, I’d bet that a psychological tendency to panic plays a big role. It seems plausible that this tendency is more pronounced among investors who are older and therefore have less time before retirement for their portfolios to recover from a bear market. This tendency also could be stronger among those who have others besides themselves to support financially, explaining why marital status and number of dependents also are correlated with panic selling.

I’d also bet that overconfidence plays a role, given the poor odds that all of us face when trying to time the stock market. This would explain why self-declared investment experience and knowledge are correlated with panic selling. It would also explain the correlation with gender, as past behavioral studies have found that men are predisposed toward overconfidence.

Regardless of the causes, though, the researchers’ results are strong enough that it behooves us to pay close attention. Using artificial intelligence, the researchers construct a model to predict whether an investor will engage in panic selling, and they found that their model had an impressive success rate. This reinforces the conclusion that, if you are in one of the demographic categories associated with a higher frequency of panic selling, you need to exercise special care to ensure during bear markets to not freak out and panic sell.

Those not in one of these particular demographic categories should not become complacent, however. We all are capable of panicking, even if some of us have a greater predisposition to do so than others.

The problem is the panic, not the selling

It’s worth emphasizing that the reason not to panic sell isn’t that it’s never a good idea to sell. The problem is that we shouldn’t do so rashly, out of panic. If you’re selling according to a predetermined financial plan, good for you. Your road map undoubtedly also indicates when you should get back in, and your challenge will be not to second-guess that road map but to instead follow it.

What you want to avoid at all costs is finding yourself in the middle of a bear market—like now—without a road map. That’s because your emotions are hard to resist, and you’ll be tempted to panic and sell at all costs. Far more often than not, you’ll eventually regret the portfolio decisions you make.

55,Why Is the Stock Market Down Today Dow Slides SP Dips Into Bear Market,2022-05-20 14:11:00,"The stock market’s early rally didn’t last long on Friday, as the S&P 500 entered bear market territory, down more than 20% from its January record high.

In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 412 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 was down 1.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.1%. All three indexes began the day with gains. If the S&P 500 closes below 3837, it would officially be in a bear market. It touched 3810 this afternoon.

The Dow was on pace to post an eighth straight weekly loss, the worst losing streak since 1932. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were on track to fall for seven straight weeks, their worst showing since 2001.

Much of the decline in investor confidence this week stems from lackluster retail earnings, which has raised fears that a consumer-led downturn is approaching, Canaccord Genuity analyst Martin Roberge noted, as both revenues and margins could come under pressure at these companies in the coming quarters. “[T]he surge in goods prices and inflation translates into demand destruction as consumers have little choice but to shift their spending patterns toward essentials,” he wrote.

That said, Roberge pointed to some silver linings, including the decline in U.S. bond yields, a leveling off for the U.S. dollar and commodities, and partial reopening in China. “These green shoots should allow markets to enjoy the typical relief rallies seen around the -20% correction mark,” Roberge wrote—but warned that if they don’t, a -30% correction could be next.

Speaking of China, sentiment was boosted earlier Friday after the People’s Bank of China lowered the key five-year prime loan rate for the second time this year. The move to 4.45% to 4.6% was the largest cut on record.

It’s the kind of narrative-changing move the market needed following Wednesday’s rout, which wiped out some $1.5 trillion in market value, but it hasn’t been enough to soothe investors’ jangled nerves.

The Federal Reserve, of course, is raising interest rates and draining money from the economy as it tries to get inflation under control. That’s raised the risk of a recession in the coming months if the Fed tightens too much. Still, there were signs on Thursday that the market was wrestling with how much more it needed to fall to reflect those risks.

“Historically, the S&P 500 has fallen an average of 29% around recession (median of 24%). The market is effectively already pricing in a 60%-75% chance of recession based on the average and median,” wrote Truist Advisory Services Chief Market Strategist Keith Lerner. That said, he noted that given the market’s recent decline and “current oversold backdrop, we would not be sellers at these levels for investors that are aligned with their longer-term allocation targets.”

Still, there could be some small hope to end the week. “The one silver lining from the selling of the past two days was that we managed to close well off from last week’s lows, suggesting a general reluctance to become too bearish too quickly,” said Michael Hewson, an analyst at broker CMC Markets.

Cold comfort, that.

Overseas, the pan-European Stoxx 600 gained 0.7% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rallied 3%.

Here are some stocks on the move Friday:

Palo Alto Networks (ticker: PANW) shot up 7.7% after the cybersecurity company reported stronger-than-expected results and raised its guidance. It saw sales rise 29% from a year earlier to $1.4 billion in the last quarter and expects revenue to touch as high as $1.55 billion in the current quarter.

Ross Stores (ROST) tumbled 23.9% after its earnings and sales missed analyst forecasts. Its guidance was dreadful as well.

Deere (DE) has fallen 13.8% despite reporting better-than-expected earnings.

Air France-KLM (AF.France) rose 1.1% in Paris trading, after the airline group entered into discussions with private equity giant Apollo Global Management (APO) over a €500 million ($530 million) capital injection. Apollo shares rose less than 0.5% in the U.S. premarket.

Cie. Financière Richemont (CFR.Switzerland) tumbled 13.1% in Zurich trading, after the luxury group behind brands including Cartier and Montblanc reported operating profit short of analysts’ expectations. The company’s chief financial officer suggested supply-chain disruptions weren’t over and that stagflation—slowing growth and inflation—represents the largest headwind.

56,Stockmarket rout pushes SampP 500 into bearmarket territory Dow falls 500 points,2022-05-20 13:45:00,"U.S. stocks were sharply lower Friday afternoon, with the S&P 500 index slipping into bear-market territory and the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for its longest string of weekly losses in 90 years.

On Thursday, the Dow industrials and S&P 500 booked their lowest closes since March 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. For the week, the Dow is heading for a 4.6% drop, while the S&P 500 is on pace to fall 5% and the Nasdaq is poised to tumble 6.2%, FactSet data show, at last check.

What’s driving markets?

A close below 3,837.25 would confirm that the S&P 500 entered a bear market, marking a fall of 20% or more from its Jan. 3 record close.

Read: The S&P 500 is trading in bear-market territory. How far could it fall?

Wall Street initially took a cue from a strong Asian session, where the Hong Kong Hang Seng HSI, +2.96% ended about 3% higher and the China CSI 300 index 000300, +1.95% rose nearly 2%, but early gains Friday in the U.S. stock market proved fragile.

“Stocks remain on a shaky footing. Investors’ list of worries grows ever larger,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with City Index and Forex.com, in a note.

”Inflation. Interest-rate hikes. Low economic growth. Stagflation. Recession. Perhaps most importantly for stocks, the Fed is not there to provide cushion, like before,” he wrote.

Stocks were initially buoyed after the People’s Bank of China on Friday cut in its rate on five-year loans, aimed at shoring up weak housing sales by reducing mortgage costs. The country has been battling COVID outbreaks, with lockdowns in industrial hubs such as Shanghai blamed for weak factory and consumer activity data in April.

But analysts said the move also underlined concerns.

“Where the rest of the world is thinking of raising rates because of inflation, they’re cutting rates in order to help the economy,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for online brokerage firm tastytrade Inc., in a phone interview. “I think that’s a little bit of a warning sign,” as U.S. companies that benefit from demand in China may be hurt by a slowing Chinese economy as well as supply-chain disruptions linked to the country’s lockdowns, he said.

The S&P 500 traded into bear-market territory Friday afternoon, with all of its 11 sectors down, FactSet data show, at last check.

Friday is the final day of trading before the expiration of options tied to stocks and exchange-traded funds, which is seen potentially contributing to volatility ahead of the end of the session.

Major U.S. stock indexes remain on track for another week of losses, with investors worried about whether soaring inflation can be brought under control by the Federal Reserve without derailing the economy.

The Dow is heading for its eighth straight weekly decline, which would be its longest since April 1932, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were on track for a seventh straight weekly fall, the longest streak for each since 2001.

Major retailers this week, such as Walmart WMTand Target TGT reported disappointing profits, against a backdrop of rising expenses and inflation.

Mark Hulbert: Here’s the real reason the stock market is coming unglued — and it isn’t because of weak earnings

This past week has shown that the risk of economic downturn, fears that high inflation is cutting into corporate performance and rising borrowing costs remain the major worry for markets, particularly after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank “won’t hesitate” to lift rates beyond neutral to curb high inflation, according to Christian Stocker, lead equity sector strategist at UniCredit Bank in Munich.

“In this environment, investor sentiment is fickle and markets are likely to remain choppy to both sides until there is greater clarity in terms of recession, rates, and geopolitical risks,” Stocker said.

The U.S. economic data calendar is empty for Friday, but next week will bring another round of inflation data, personal consumption expenditure prices excluding food and energy.

57,An Analyst Downgraded Wix Investors Want to See Growth,2022-05-20 13:23:00,"Investors are waiting on Wix to show them recovery and profitability after a pull forward in demand during Covid-19 and other market challenges stalled growth, according to Morgan Stanley.

“We continue to believe Wix has a best-in-class product benefiting from fast-paced innovation, however we are moving to an Equal Weight rating (from Overweight),” Morgan Stanley analyst Elizabeth Porter wrote in a research note Friday morning.

She maintained her $85 price target after the downgrade.

Wix stock (ticker: WIX) was down 2.2% Friday to $67.12 and has fallen 58% year to date while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite Index has fallen 28%.

The web development company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

“We continue to view Wix as having a best-in-class product portfolio and are encouraged by the focus on improving profitability, but see the benefits skewed to FY23 and beyond,” Porter said.

As a result, investors are waiting on evidence of execution before giving credit to a 2023 growth story, she said.

Porter said management’s focus on profitability is promising, but it is likely those results won’t come until 2023. She is optimistic, though, regarding the revenue growth outlined by management on the company’s analyst day, including a rebound in revenue growth of 10% to 13% in 2022 and 21% to 23% in 2023.

There are some possible upsides too, she said, including a faster return of website building demand from self-creators and agencies, accelerated pace of B2B [business to business] partnerships announcements, and price increases which will impact 2022 revenue. She also said the overall macro risk for the rest of 2022 is limited.

58,How Long Do Bear Markets Last SP 500 May Fall Even More More,2022-05-20 13:20:00,"The S&P 500 entered bear-market territory in mid-day trading Friday, falling 20% below its high set in January.

Where the index goes from here is less clear. Of the 12 bear markets since World War II, nine lost at least 25%.

Three of the selloffs were particularly bloody. In 1973, 2000, and 2007, the bear markets began a steep and lasting decline of more than 40%. Five other times, the S&P 500 tumbled very close to bear market territory, just like today, but never quite hit a 20% loss.

For the nine markets that posted more than a 25% drop, the average peak-to-trough decline was 38%. Excluding the more than 40% drops in 1973, 2000 and 2007, the average decline was only 31%. “This could explain why so many investors are targeting a 30% decline,” Martin Roberge, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, wrote in a note on Wednesday.

There has been a lot of talk about the short-lived “relief rallies” that tend to take place after the market falls by 20%. They often last about two months before things turn ugly again. If a relief rally happens this time, it could last until the start of the second-quarter earnings season, Roberge wrote. This would give investors a chance to unload some of their equity holdings in preparation for worse times.

There are exceptions to this road map. During the 1987 and 2020 flash crashes, the S&P 500 didn’t have relief rallies. If the current selloff is anything like those, wrote Roberge, stocks will lose another 10% to 15% until they reach a bottom in June.

Much scarier were the deep bear markets in 1973, 2000, and 2007, where the S&P 500 plunged an average of 51.4% before touching the bottom. These selloffs were painful and long. From the point when index entered a bear market, it took another 258 days, on average, before it reached the trough.

If the current selloff were to follow this path, a true market bottom won’t be reached until the second quarter of 2023, according to Roberge. “Frankly, we doubt that a 50%+ bear market is in the cards since short- and long-term rates are much lower today,” he wrote. “Still, this is not a 0% probability event.”

Besides the historical records, there are a few other factors that look concerning.

Stocks were historically expensive before the current selloff. Even after the 20% drop, the S&P 500 is still trading around 18 times earnings. For the past bear markets, the index didn’t hit the bottom until it reached 12 times earnings, on average. That means even if company earnings remain stable in the coming months, stocks could still tumble another 30% from here before they find an equilibrium in valuations.

Also unusual: The Federal Reserve continues to promise aggressive rate hikes even though the market is down nearly 20%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that the central bank is determined to get rampant inflation under control regardless of market reactions to rising rates.

In the past bear markets, the Fed has only hiked interest rates once—in March 1974. It didn’t end well. The S&P 500 was down 22% from peak at the time of the rate hike; it didn’t bottom until six months later, when it had lost 48% of its value.

What’s driving the market

Treasury yields resumed their slide on Friday from levels seen in early May, when the 10-year topped 3.2%. Meanwhile, in equity markets Dow industrials, the S&P 500 index and the Nasdaq Composite all gave up earlier gains as the New York morning wore on. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.88% sat on the edge of the 3,837.25 closing value that would mark the technical definition of a bear market.

See: Selloff puts S&P 500 on bear market’s doorstep. If history is a guide, there’s more pain ahead.

Investor risk appetite was lifted only briefly on Friday, after the People’s Bank of China lowered its benchmark lending rate for loans of five years or more, a key reference rate for home mortgages. The country has been battling COVID outbreaks, with lockdowns in industrial hubs such as Shanghai blamed for weak factory and consumer activity data in April.



Fears of stagflation —- a combination of persistent inflation and stagnant growth —- are on the rise and have been key market drivers, analysts said. The Federal Reserve is seen sticking with its plans to aggressively raise interest rates and shrink its balance sheet in an effort to get price pressures under control.

No major U.S. economic data is on tap for Friday.

What analysts are saying

Thursday’s price action made it clear, “with economic data starting to waver, that bonds are reassuming their time-tested position as a risk-off hedge against an economic slowdown,” wrote Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a note.

60,Targetdate funds are taking a beating along with everything else  Take a step back advisers say,2022-05-20 11:46:00,"Market volatility hasn’t been kind to retirement accounts, even those invested in target-date funds retirement savers and retirees alike use to automatically adjust their exposure to risk.

Target-date funds are mutual funds or exchange-traded funds geared to a certain maturity date, often an investor’s approximate retirement date. They contain a mix of investments that are structured to be riskier at inception, and automatically shift to become more conservative near the time of maturity. They are very popular in 401(k) and IRA accounts, are often the “default” investment option in employee retirement accounts, and are considered to be something an investor can “set and forget,” since the rebalancing happens automatically.

For retirees or near-retirees with 2020 target-date funds who may have anticipated their portfolios to be somewhat protected because of the automatic adjustments, the recent market volatility, which has punished stocks and bonds alike, may be a cause for concern.

After all, many Americans rely on Social Security and any retirement savings they have accumulated through their careers to fund the rest of their days.

“It’s not a matter of ‘if,’ it’s a matter of ‘when’ we have these instances,” said Chris Mellone, a certified financial planner and financial adviser at VLP Financial Advisors, who said he prepares his clients for the downturns even when everything is looking good, like in the fall of 2019. “It is never going to be perfect.”

See: You just retired and your target-date fund has plunged. What do you do now?

Right now, investments are looking far from perfect. The S&P 500 index undefined is down 17.52% year-to-date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.73% dropped 13.45% and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.39% declined 26.41% during the same time frame.

Funds for recent retirees, such as 2020 target-date funds, have also suffered – regardless the fund provider. To name a few: the Fidelity Freedom 2020 Fund FFFDX, +0.29% is down about 13% year-to-date; the Invesco Peak Retirement 2020 Fund PKTIX, -1.34% saw a nearly 11% year-to-date decline; JPMorgan SmartRetirement 2020 Fund JTTIX, -1.11% fell 12% year-to-date; the year-to-date drop for Transamerica ClearTrack 2020 TCSUX, +0.11% is about 13%; and the Vanguard Target Retirement 2020 Fund VTWNX, +0.15% declined around 12% year-to-date.

Asset allocations for 2020 target-date funds vary by provider but hover around a 50-50 mix for equities and fixed income. Exposure to risk is important in retirees’ portfolios, as they need that money to generate returns for the decades left in retirement. Still, it can be scary to see when the market is volatile.

Investors choose target-date funds if they’re not interested in the do-it-yourself approach or perhaps don’t have a financial adviser to build out a portfolio for them. But target-date funds are not a surefire way to protect against volatility, even if they are automatically adjusted to take on more conservative investments as the years go on.

“It’s like being on a passenger jet,” said Wheeler Pulliam, a certified financial planner and founder of Xponify Financial. “Everyone is fine walking about the cabin when the plane is cruising along on autopilot at 36,000 ft. But when turbulence happens, no one’s running around carefree anymore and everyone wants to hear what the pilot has to say about things then. Unfortunately, the nature of passive investments doesn’t allow for any major changes during turbulent times like today.”

A portfolio invested in a target-date fund might also not be appropriate for near or current retirees.

“A target-date fund makes great sense when you’re starting your working career and are undecided about what to do,“ said Erika Safran, a certified financial planner and founder of Safran Wealth Advisors. “Sometimes you just don’t know what you don’t know.” As investors get older, save more for retirement, earn a higher salary and prepare for their old age, target-date funds may no longer serve them, she said.

This is because so many factors change between the beginning of one’s career and the end, Mellone said. Painting a portfolio with a broad brush at the start of a career by using a target-date fund is understandable – these portfolios are heavily invested in equities, and young investors’ investments can weather the volatility they’ll inevitably face in the three or four decades to follow.

Retirees, on the other hand, have various different financial needs and goals, depending on if they plan to move, how much they intend to spend in retirement, if they’ll be earning any additional income or what expenses they have in old age. These timelines, needs and goals will affect what constitutes an appropriate asset allocation – for many, a simple 50-50 breakdown just won’t do.

Now isn’t the time to make any drastic changes, but those who feel they need to make an adjustment should discuss this plan with a financial professional, or proceed with caution. Changing a portfolio just to change it in times of turmoil isn’t prudent, however if it was a tweak that should have been made months ago and someone was avoiding it because of market volatility, it’s not wrong to do so now, Safran said.

“One would have said it was too late three months ago, and now we are pretty much worse than we were three months ago,” Safran said. “Is it too late? That’s the big question. My response to that is going to be the same as it is in real life. If it is something you should have done and haven’t done, go ahead and do it.”

Investors may also want to rebalance their portfolios, which would restore a portfolio to its original asset allocation. Portfolios tend to shift over time, especially during volatility, becoming over- or underweighted in equities or fixed income. That shift can become problematic for an investor if the new portfolio mix doesn’t align with investors’ needs and goals.

Retirees should also build out a cash reserve, equivalent to one or two years’ worth of expenses, to avoid withdrawing from the market when it’s volatile, Safran said.

But in the midst of what feels like a chaotic time for investors, it’s important to keep a portfolio with a 2020 target-date fund in context with the rest of the market.

61,Its likely the stock market will rally this summer But dont expect the gains to hold,2022-05-20 11:24:00,"Will a summer rally rescue the stock market from its relentless decline?

Some beleaguered bulls are shifting their hopes to seasonal strength during the summer months, since nothing else appears able to stanch the bleeding. The S&P 500 SPX, -0.88% has fallen 16% just since late March, while the Nasdaq COMP, -1.39% has fallen 22%. Both declines are unusually severe for such a short period of time.

My research produces both good and bad news about a possible summer rally. The good news is that, based on historical averages alone, the stock market is likely to be 7.3% higher than where it stands today at some point this summer. In terms of the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.73% , that’s a gain of nearly 2,300 points.

The bad news is that there’s nothing special about this potential. Similar potentials, or greater, exist for other months of the calendar as well.

Precisely defining the summer rally poses a special challenge to researchers, since most who refer to the rally fail to say what exactly it entails. It can’t be just that the stock market will rally at some point during the summer, since it certainly will —sooner or later. It also will certainly decline at some point as well.

To ensure I had captured the greatest possible rally potential for the summer, I measured the stock market’s gain from the end of May to its highest level during the three-month period from June 1 to Aug. 31. This gain is hypothetical, of course, since only in retrospect will we know when that highest level has been hit. But it’s hard to imagine that, when using any other definition, the summer rally could be any bigger.

I applied my definition to the Dow Jones Industrial Average back to its creation in 1896. On average, the summer rally as so defined measured 7.3%. That’s how much the market will rally from the end of May to its highest level during the coming months of June, July and August — assuming this summer is “average.”

While such a rally would be very welcome, it needs to be put in context. The accompanying chart does that by reporting the average rally potential for all months of the calendar when measured in the same way. That is, for January, I measured the gain from the end of the month to its highest level in the subsequent February, March and April. For February, I measured the gain from its end to its highest level in the subsequent March, April and May. I did the same for all other months as well.

The average rally potential across all months is 7.3%, which is the same as it is for May individually. Four other months have a greater potential (January, February, June and December), though the differences between those months and the others is not significant at the 95% confidence level that statisticians often use when determining if a pattern is genuine.

From a seasonal perspective, in other words, the stock market’s rally potential is the same throughout the calendar.

The bottom line? The market will undoubtedly rally at some point this summer. But there’s no seasonally based justification for expecting a stronger such rally this summer than at any other time of the year. That, in turn, means you shouldn’t change your current investment posture just because summer is about to begin.

The bull market will need something strong than a summer rally to keep it alive.

62,A bearmarket rally could be lurking but investors should sell any rips says Bank of America,2022-05-20 11:18:00,"Despite the extensive losses seen for stock markets so far this year, it’s not over until it’s over — and investors should keep selling into any big rebounds higher.

That’s the advice from a team of strategists at Bank of America, led by Michael Hartnett, in their Friday “Flow Show” note. In focus for the bank is increasing debate about whether the market has capitulated, which refers to investors basically giving up on trying to recapture lost gains.

Some strategists view capitulation as a sign the market has bottomed and a good time to buy stocks. However, even a near 1,200-point drop for the Dow industrials DJIA, -0.73% earlier this week, a bear market for the Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.40% and a near one for the S&P 500 SPX, -0.89% hasn’t convinced everyone the selling is over.

Stocks were rising on Friday morning, but major indexes were still set to add to a string of weekly losses.

Bank of America pointed out that high cash levels for investors —- it reported earlier this week that global fund managers’ cash allocations were the highest since 2001 —- and its own contrarian bull/bear indicator are both pointing to capitulation.

BofA Global Research

But other pieces of the puzzle are missing, they said. For example, both the bank’s institutional and private client flows aren’t at capitulation lows. Among its private clients with $2.9 trillion in assets under management, 62.8% is allocated to stocks (lowest since February 2021), 18% to bonds (highest since July 2021) and 12.1% cash (highest since Jan. 2021).

Of course, they note, there is no “true capitulation” involving the Federal Reserve in sight. That tends to mean a massive market pullback that gets the central bank to ease up on tightening monetary policy. A systemic event and rise in the unemployment rate would be required first, said Hartnett.

BofA Global Research

The bottom line is that the stock market is “very vulnerable to [a] bear rally, but we would still argue ‘sell any rips,’ said Hartnett and the team.

But it’s on track to be down for seven straight weeks — the first time since 2002, when it fell for eight consecutive weeks.

Tesla TSLA, -8.31% CEO Elon Musk continues to wrangle with Twitter’s TWTR, +1.56% board of directors over how many of the social-media company’s user accounts might be fake. The drama may be Musk’s basis for negotiating a lower price than his original offer of $54.20 a share for Twitter. Investors don’t expect the deal in its current form to be completed, with Twitter’s shares closing at only $37.29 on May 19.

But Musk’s gambit may cost him much more than a $1 billion breakup fee if he walks away from Twitter.

Shares of Tesla have fallen 28% since April 12, the day before Musk made his offer to Twitter’s board to take the company private. On May 19, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who continues to rate Tesla’s stock “outperform,” cut his price target for the shares by 40% to $1,000. Tesla’s stock closed at $709.42 on May 19.

64,Elon Musk Seeks to Reassure Tesla Investors Over Twitter Deal,2022-05-20 10:26:00,"Elon Musk had a message for Twitter and Tesla investors. Fixing the social media company wouldn’t be rocket science.

Musk took to Twitter (ticker: TWTR) Thursday evening, perhaps to reassure Tesla (TSLA) investor about the planned deal, saying that Twitter won’t take up too much of his time. “I’m spending

Musk, of course, knows something about rocket science. He runs SpaceX, the privately held aerospace company that pioneered reusable rockets.

Tesla stock was up 2% in premarket trading Friday. Musk’s post on Twitter might explain part of the move. Tesla investors have been worried about management distraction since Musk’s initial Twitter stake was disclosed in early April. Tesla stock is down about 38% since then. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are off 15% and 22%, respectively.

“While the Twitter situation in theory does not impact the Tesla fundamental story, the distraction risks for Musk (perception is reality) are hard to ignore,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives on Thursday. The Twitter bid comes “at a time that the Tesla ecosystem have never needed Musk more with the worst supply chain crisis seen in modern history.”

Neither Tesla nor SpaceX immediately responded to a request for comment.

The overall market is stronger Friday. That obscures just how much benefit Tesla shares are deriving from Musk’s Twitter. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up about 1% and 0.8%, respectively.

Tesla stock is more volatile than the market. It tends to rise faster when things are going well and fall harder when investor fears rise.

Musk told investors, on Twitter, recently that the Twitter purchase was on hold pending his investigation into the issue of spam bots. Twitter believes spam accounts make up about 5% of daily active usage. Musk believes the number is far higher and said as much on a podcast earlier this week.

Investors don’t seem to have a feel for how the Twitter-Musk saga will turn out. Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) co-founder Gary Black ran a poll on Twitter and found that while some 16% of respondent said they would wait and see the survey results, about 10% of active respondents, those who made a call, think the Twitter purchase will happen at the original $54.20 price. Some 40% of active respondents believe a lower price is coming and 50% think Musk will walk away.

Almost 10,000 people voted in the poll. About half think a deal happens. The other half doesn’t. Tesla is the largest position in the Future Fund.

Coming into Friday trading, Tesla stock is off about 33% year to date. The Musk-related drama might be a part of that, but automotive stocks have been hurt by investor fears over inflation and rising interest rates. General Motors (GM) stock, for instance, is down about 38% year to date.

65,Tesla Loses Top Spot in Cathie Woods Flagship Fund Roku Is the New No 1,2022-05-20 10:15:00,"ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood is a long-time Tesla bull. Her 2026 price target for the electric-vehicle maker’s shares is $4,600. Tesla, though, isn’t the largest holding in ARK Innovation ETF anymore.

That distinction now goes to video streaming streaming service provider Roku (ticker: ROKU). It accounts for about 8.4% of ARK Innovation’s holdings. Tesla (TSLA) accounts for about 8.2% of the fund.

The rest of the top five holdings are: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) at 7.9%, Exact Sciences (EXAS) at 5.9% and Block (SQ) at 5.7%.

Tesla doesn’t seem to have lost its top spot as part of an explicit trading strategy. Recent stock market performance has changed the relative rankings. Coming into Friday trading, Tesla stock has dropped 27% over the past month. Roku has declined only 12%.

Tesla stock has been battered by the tech selloff. CEO Elon Musk’s potential purchase of Twitter (TWTR) also has become an overhang on the shares. Tesla stock is down about 38% since Musk’s initial Twitter stake was disclosed. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have fallan about 15% and 22% over the same span.

Investors appear to be worried about how much Musk has on his plate. He runs Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company and Neuralink. Musk took to Twitter on Friday to reassure Tesla shareholders than Twitter was only taking about 5% of his time and Tesla was on his mind 24/7.

The decline in Tesla stock, along with other high-growth names, has hurt Wood’s fund. ARK Innovation is down about 23% over the past month and about 55% year to date.

Investors have shunned the highest growth, more speculative stocks as interest rates have risen. High-growth companies generate most of their earnings far in the future and higher interest rates make those earnings worth less when discounted back to today. That’s one reason why rising rates tend to hurt richly valued stocks more than others.

Tesla stock was is up about 2.3% in premarket trading on Friday. Roku shares have gained about 2.5%. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose up about 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively.

“You have to think about the fact that there’s a reasonable chance at some point that we have a recession or we have, you know, very, very slow, sluggish growth,” Solomon said.

But he also cautioned that a recession is far from a sure thing.

“That doesn’t mean that that’s definitely going to happen,” he continued. “But certainly, I think that if you’re running a significant enterprise, you have to be looking through a lens with a little bit more caution right now than you might have been when we were sitting here a year ago.”

Solomon also noted that the recent “tightening” of economic conditions has been predictable based on inflation data and the interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

68,Bitcoin Is Rising Crypto Traders Are Still Preparing for the Worst,2022-05-20 08:41:00,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were rallying on Friday as digital assets continued a recent outperformance of stocks, though there are signs in the derivatives market that crypto traders are preparing for a move downward.

The price of Bitcoin rose 4% over the past 24 hours to around $30,500. The largest crypto was still trading around the lowest point all year, but comfortably higher than recent levels below $30,000 and well above near $26,000 low reached in last week’s cryptocurrency crash.

“Bitcoin is hovering around the $30,000 level as investors continue to shy away from stocks,” wrote Edward Moya, an analyst at broker Oanda. “A weaker dollar and bear market stock fears are making Bitcoin attractive again.”

Bitcoin and its peers should theoretically trade independently of mainstream financial markets, but have largely shown themselves to be correlated with other risk-sensitive assets—like stocks, and especially tech stocks—over the past year. Some of that correlation has recently faded, with Bitcoin actually outperforming stock indexes like the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq this week.

The leading digital asset has gained almost 10% since Monday, when it changed hands around $29,500. By comparison, based on stock-index futures indicating the U.S. market open on Friday, the S&P 500 has lost 2% this week while the Nasdaq-100 is down 3%.

Stocks are in a rough patch, with the Nasdaq remaining deep in bear market territory—down 28% this year—and the S&P 500 flirting with a bear market.

“Bitcoin looks poised to consolidate [around $30,000], but bulls should be happy to see prices are not mimicking what happens with the stock market,” Moya wrote.

Bitcoin is trading at its lowest levels since July 2021, and remains at less than half its all-time high near $69,000 reached in November. By comparison, the S&P 500 closed on Thursday at its lowest level since March 2021.

The leading digital asset is recovering ever-so slowly from its recent crash, which was largely linked to spillover from a stock market selloff and fueled by the collapse of a systemically-important stablecoin meant to be pegged to the U.S. dollar.

“It seems the fallout from all the stablecoin drama that sent cryptos sharply lower is finally fading,” wrote Moya.

That stablecoin, TerraUSD, continued to trade at a severe discount to the dollar—7 cents. Luna, a related token that through an arbitrage market mechanism is meant to keep Terra on its peg, was changing hands at one-hundredth of a penny. It was at $80 two weeks ago, when it was one of the largest digital assets.

But there remain indications in the derivatives market that crypto traders are readying for—or even betting on—another major downward move in Bitcoin prices.

“The put/call ratio for Bitcoin open interest hit a 12-month high of 0.72 yesterday, indicating bearish sentiment among investors,” wrote a team at crypto market intelligence firm Delphi Digital.

A put/call ratio describes the environment of bets in the options market; puts are bets on prices moving lower, while calls are bets that prices will jump.

“A high put/call ratio indicates that investors are speculating whether bitcoin will continue to sell off, or it could mean investors are hedging their portfolios against a downward move,” the analysts at Delphi said. “Last April, the put/call ratio traded as high as 0.96 before Bitcoin’s price dropped over 50% in May 2021.”

Beyond Bitcoin, the crypto Ether was even more buoyant. The token underpinning the Ethereum blockchain network rose 5% to above $2,050, well above last week’s trough below $1,800, but still down by nearly one-third from two weeks ago.

Smaller cryptos, or altcoins, also gained. Solana rose 4%, Cardano was up 2%, and Avalanche jumped 7%. Memecoins, which were initially intended as internet jokes rather than serious cryptocurrency prospects, were similarly in the green; Dogecoin and Shiba Inu both rallied 2%.

69,Cisco Stock Tumbles What to Know,2022-05-19 15:01:00,"Shares of Cisco Systems are tumbling Thursday because of the company’s disappointing financial results last night. They paint a complex picture of the current state of the tech business.

With Cisco shares down 14% on the day, the stock looks cheap. But there are challenges ahead and unresolved questions that will take time to answer.

The Key Details from Earnings

For the fiscal third quarter ended April 30, Cisco (ticker: CSCO) reported revenue of $12.8 billion, which was flat with a year ago, falling well shy of the company’s own forecast for growth in the 3% to 5% range. Thanks to better-than-expected margins, non-GAAP profits of 87 cents a share actually hit the high end of the company’s target forecast of 85 to 87 cents.

The company said two issues triggered the revenue shortfall. The first was the company’s decision to stop selling products in Russia and Belarus due to the war in Ukraine. That resulted in a $200 million hit to the top-line. Cisco noted that historically, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine combined account for 1% of its revenue. It’s an issue affecting many companies, and that factor alone likely isn’t having much impact on the stock.

The bigger issue involves Covid-19 shutdowns of manufacturing and transportation in China, particularly around Shanghai. On a more granular level, CEO Chuck Robbins said the company was unable to get enough power supply components, reducing its ability to ship finished goods to customers. While manufacturers are producing parts, logistics issues are making it impossible to get them from factories to local ports and onto ships, Robbins said. And he added that the problem is unlikely to be sorted out in the current quarter.

Sure enough, Cisco’s guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter ending in July was a huge miss. Cisco sees revenue for the quarter of between 1% and 5.5%; Wall Street had been projecting a nearly 6% increase. That comes to a top-line shortfall of $1 billion top-line.

No Change in Demand, Cisco Says

Robbins and CFO Scott Herren both insist that, aside from Ukraine situation, the April quarter issues—and those laid out for the July quarter—are 100% related to supply, and reflect no change in demand. That’s heartening, and helps explain why the stock is not down even more.

The tricky issue — and the ammunition for Cisco bears — is the fact that orders have slowed from artificially high pandemic levels.

Over the previous three quarters, Cisco has reported order growth in the 31% to 33% range—but the total fell to 8% in the April quarter. Robbins notes that order growth would have been 10% had the company not stopped doing business in Russia, in line with the year-ago quarter growth rate. Arguably, the big growth numbers from the last three quarters—33% order growth in the January quarter —had easy comparisons with year earlier quarters which were muted by the pandemic. But now Cisco faces three quarters of difficult comparisons.

Complicating the picture is that enterprise orders—business from Cisco’s largest customers—were flat in the quarter, after growing 37% in the January quarter. CFO Herren says those large orders are inherently lumpy, and he advised investors not to read that as any slowdown in demand.

But it is unsettling, and investors aren’t entirely buying the “lumpy” argument. It’s also worth noting that demand from “webscale” customers—large cloud computing players—was up more than 50% in the quarter but also below the level seen in recent quarters. Webscale orders over the last 12 months are up about 100% year over year.

“Peers are not seeing this level of disruption.”

During the Q&A section of the company’s earnings call, a few analysts noted that Cisco’s results seemed more impacted by issues in China than those from other hardware players whose quarters ended in March. Robbins said that the primary supply issues occurred in April, the start of a new quarter for many other hardware companies.

Sure enough, during Apple’s (AAPL) last earnings call in late April, CEO Tim Cook cautioned that his company’s June quarter revenue would be trimmed by $4 billion to $8 billion by Covid-related disruptions and industrywide silicon shortages. Cook specifically called out manufacturing constraints “in the Shanghai corridor.” In other words, there have been hints that the China lockdowns could ding results from other hardware companies—like Cisco.

Cisco’s comments on a shortage of power supplies are weighing heavily on both other networking equipment stocks and other hardware names more generally. Among networking companies, Arista Networks (ANET) shares are off 2% Thursday, Ciena (CIEN) is down 3%, and Juniper Networks (JNPR) is 4% lower. Arista and Juniper already posted their March quarter results, while Ciena is due to report its April quarter earnings on June 2.

Investors are now worried about other hardware stocks with off-cycle quarters, as well, including PC makers HP Inc. (HPQ), down 3% Thursday, and Dell Technologies (DELL), off 4%. Enterprise hardware and networking company HP Enterprise ( HPE ) shares are down 6%. They all report results over the next several weeks.

Apple is down 2% on the day, while IBM is off 3%. Both moves likely reflect that investors are getting more worried about overall technology spending, despite Cisco’s insistence that demand remains strong.

The declines came even as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was enjoying a rare day in positive territory.

Robbins has often referred to Cisco’s skill at managing through supply-chain issues, but some analysts wonder if the company’s current component issues are partly of its own making. Needham analyst Alex Henderson, who has a Hold rating on Cisco shares, points out that Arista recently raised guidance, and that Extreme Networks (EXTR) said at a meeting with analysts yesterday that Covid shutdowns were not affecting its outlook.

“Peers are not seeing this level of disruption,” Henderson writes of Cisco’s issues.

Jefferies analyst George Notter thinks Cisco deserves some of the blame. “We’re wondering if Cisco’s isn’t executing crisply with its supply-chain team,” he writes. “Based on our analysis, Cisco was slow to ramp Inventories and purchase commitments while other equipment vendors—such as Arista—reacted several quarters before Cisco. Hence, we’re wondering if supply chain execution is a contributing factor.” That said, he keeps his Buy rating on the stock.

A slew of Wall Street analysts trimmed their price targets for Cisco in the wake of the earnings report, and almost all of them cut their forecasts not only for this quarter, but also for the July 2023 fiscal year.

Wall Street Remains Bullish, Mostly

But multiple analysts see a buying opportunity. Cisco stock now trades for just over 11 times expected profits for fiscal 2023, an undemanding valuation that helps explains the relatively modest reaction to the company’s weak report. Cisco’s decline looks tame compared with Target’s (TGT) drop of 25% on Wednesday after its disappointing earnings report.

Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani concedes that the quarter—and the company’s supply chain execution—are “frustrating,” but he sees the issues as transitory and expects better performance ahead. Strong free cash flow and a modest valuation, he writes, makes Cisco “a name investors should stick with.”

Citi analyst Jim Suva, who points out in his research note that he is the only Wall Street analyst with a Sell rating on Cisco shares, remains cautious. Suva thinks Cisco’s long-term sales guidance for annual growth of 5% to 7% through fiscal 2025 is too high given the supply challenges, which he thinks are triggering market share losses.

Cisco shares are down 14.3% on Thursday, to $41.44. The stock is down 35% this year.

70,Dollar gains stocks turn south on Fedinduced slowdown fears,2022-05-20 16:55:56,"
Shares had rebounded earlier in Europe and Asia after China cut a key lending benchmark to bolster its weakening economy, helping drive early gains on Wall Street.

China cut its prime rate for five-year loans, which influences mortgage prices, by 15 basis points in a reduction that was sharper than expected as authorities seek to cushion the impact of an economic slowdown. read more


U.S. Treasury yields fell for a third straight session on concerns about growth prospects. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes fell 5.6 basis points to 2.799%.

Equity valuations need to come down and the expected return on investments, the discount rate, needs to go up, said Stephen Auth, chief investment officer of equities at Federated Hermes.

""The market is starting to digest the idea that this might be a new world where the discount rate on risk assets is not zero anymore,"" Auth said.

""You're seeing all these different areas of the market get pounded at the same time and it's just been very unsettling for investors,"" he added.

The pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) closed up a preliminary 0.73%. MSCI's gauge of stocks in 47 countries (.MIWD00000PUS) shed 0.45%, on track on track for its seventh consecutive weekly decline, its longest losing streak since the index was launched in 1990.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 1.09%, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 1.28% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 1.83%.

Fed funds futures were firmer, suggesting that the U.S. rate market has pulled back a bit from some of its more extreme rate hike estimates. The rates market has priced in a fed funds rate of 2.783% at the end of next year, compared with a current level of 0.83%. The rate was as high as 2.9% two weeks ago.

The dollar recouped some of its recent losses against the euro but remained on pace for its worst weekly loss against the common currency since early February as investors questioned whether the greenback's month-long rally was done.

The dollar has been supported in recent months by a flight to safety amid a rout across markets due to fears of soaring inflation, a hawkish Fed and the war in Ukraine.

The dollar index rose 0.136%, with the euro down 0.29% to $1.0555. The Japanese yen strengthened 0.01% to 127.78 per dollar.

Euro zone bond yields were higher after two days of hefty falls as risk sentiment improved following China's rate cut.

Germany's 10-year government bond yield fell 1.2 basis points to 0.932%, well below last week's eight-year high of 1.189%.

Markets are pricing in 38 basis points of tightening from the European Central Bank by its July meeting . This suggests a 25 basis point hike is fully priced in and markets see around a 50/50 chance of an additional 25 basis point move. read more

Oil prices steadied, on course for little change for the week as a planned European Union ban on Russian oil balanced concerns that slowing economic growth will hurt demand.

U.S. crude rose 0.08% to $112.30 per barrel and Brent was at $111.64, down 0.36% on the day.

Gold eased 0.1% to $1,840.71 an ounce as the dollar, in which bullion is priced, rebounded from two-week lows. But the safe-haven metal was still likely to post its first weekly gain in five.

71,Dollar selling takes a pause after bruising week,2022-05-20 14:55:05,"
NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar recouped some of its losses against the euro on Friday, but remained set for its worst weekly performance against the common currency since early February as investors questioned whether the greenback's month-long rally was done.

The greenback has been supported in recent months by a flight to safety by investors, amid a rout across markets due to fears of the impact of soaring inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

That rally, however, sputtered this week as increased volatility in global financial markets sent investors to the yen and the Swiss franc for safety.


The dollar was up about 0.3% against the euro. For the week the U.S. currency was down about 1.5%, its worst weekly showing against the euro since early February.

""The buck struggled to keep afloat this week as the rush to safety resulted in higher U.S. Treasury bond prices and lower yields,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington, D.C.

""Meanwhile, an improving timeframe and trajectory for ECB interest rate hikes gave the euro an added boost,"" Manimbo said.

Euro zone money markets on Friday ramped up their bets on a 50 basis-point interest rate hike from the European Central Bank in July that would bring the bank's policy rate to 0%.

Earlier this week, Dutch central bank governor and ECB policymaker Klaas Knot said the bank should keep the door open to a 50 bps hike if upcoming data suggested inflation was ""broadening further or accumulating"". read more

The dollar's retreat this week came after it hit a more than 5-year high against the euro last week.

""We see the buck as a bit elevated for sure and see room for other currencies to flourish as there is a gradual shift to better prospects if the global economy is to be helped out and revived from a terrible first half to the year,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA in Washington.

Other safe-haven currencies have rallied this week as global equities have come under pressure, although stocks in Europe clawed back some ground on Friday. read more

The Swiss franc was on track for a near 3% weekly gain versus the dollar, its best weekly gain in more than two years, while the Japanese yen was set for an almost 1% weekly gain.

Sterling, up 0.06% on Friday, was set for its biggest weekly gain since December 2020 against the dollar as the latest economic data suggested the market might not need to scale back its expectations for Bank of England rate hikes much further. read more

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was about flat at just above $30,000, arresting steep declines seen in recent weeks.

73,Cryptoloving SKoreans bet on Luna rising from ashes worrying regulator,2022-05-19 08:06:33,"
SEOUL, May 19 (Reuters) - Reckoning they have little to lose with prices so ridiculously low, South Korean speculators in recent days have piled into Luna, a cryptocurrency that lost 99.99% of its value last week after its paired stablecoin TerraUSD collapsed.

Both tokens are affiliated with Terra, a blockchain platform co-founded by Korean developer Do Kwon and, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, investors in them have lost around $42 billion.

Luna had been one of the world's most popular cryptocurrencies and its downfall, alongside TerraUSD, caused mayhem across the crypto spectrum globally, with bitcoin losing around a quarter of its value between May 9-12. read more


Worth nearly $100 in late April, Luna is now trading at a fraction of one cent - so low that there has been a rush of buying from speculators betting that it will stage a miraculous recovery, with some clinging to the belief that it is just too big to be allowed to fail.

""Luna was once a major coin of top-ten market capitalisation, so they will do whatever it takes to revive it,"" one hopeful investor wrote in a blog on South Korea's internet platform Naver, without saying who ""they"" could be.

The blogger said he had bought 300,000 Luna over the weekend at 0.33 won ($0.0003) each, using an international crypto exchange.

As the sudden resurgence of buying crossed its radar, South Korea's Financial Services Commission warned people on Tuesday against investing in Luna.

The number of investors in the failed cryptocurrency rose more than 50% in just over two days at South Korea's major exchanges to stand at 280,000 as of May 15, according to a source at the FSC who, as is customary for South Korean bureaucrats, declined to be named.

The buying mostly came from domestic speculators, though there were some inflows from abroad, the source said.

The window for speculation is limited as Bithumb and Upbit, two of South Korea's largest exchanges, said they will suspend trading support for Luna on May 27 and May 20, respectively, while another, Coinone, has halted deposits in the crypto-currency ahead of a possible de-listing on May 25.

The buying has had little affect on the token's price. It has spent the past week flopping between one-hundredth and four-hundredths of a cent.

But the propensity of South Koreans, particularly the younger ones, to invest in volatile and risky assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies has worried regulators.

Their earlier enthusiasm had helped put Luna and TerraUSD among the world's ten largest cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap.

But things fell apart on May 10, when TerraUSD's 1:1 peg to the dollar was shattered. On Wednesday it traded at around 10 cents.

Unlike most other major stablecoins which are backed by other assets, TerraUSD's value is derived by complex algorithmic processes, linked to its paired token Luna, which is free floating.

Under the system, one TerraUSD token could be swapped for $1 of Luna, and vice versa, and once swapped the coins would be destroyed.

If TerraUSD fell below $1, traders were incentivised to buy the stablecoin to swap it for $1 worth of Luna, and so reduce the supply of TerraUSD's and push its price back to $1.

That was the theory, but the market proved the premise wrong.

As the market imploded, hundreds of outraged retail investors flooded social media with tales of woe, with some of them asking Kwon to compensate their losses.

Kwon, last week, announced plans to change the system so TerraUSD will backed by reserves in future, but it is unclear whether this plan is achievable. read more

74,Analysis Crypto crash leaves El Salvador with no easy exit from worsening crisis,2022-05-19 05:34:03,"
Under populist President Nayib Bukele, a vocal cheerleader for the currency, El Salvador went all-in on bitcoin, not just becoming the world's first country to adopt it as a legal tender but also sketching out plans for a volcano-powered crypto mining hub and plans to issue the first sovereign bond linked to the coin.

With global borrowing costs on the rise and a big debt repayment on the horizon, El Salvador has other fiscal headaches than the impact of the currency's swoon. But the crypto slump has also closed some potential off-ramps from the crisis, including the now-postponed bitcoin bond.


""The government's financial problems are not because of bitcoin, but they have gotten worse because of bitcoin,"" said Ricardo Castaneda, senior economist and country coordinator for El Salvador and Honduras at think tank Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies (ICEFI). For the government, he said, ""bitcoin ceased to be a solution and has become part of the problem.""

Bitcoin has fallen 45% since El Salvador officially adopted it in early September, and 26% from its May high as crypto assets have been swept up in a risk-off investing environment.

The combined market value of all cryptocurrencies recently fell to $1.2 trillion, less than half of where it was last November, based on data from CoinMarketCap.

El Salvador's debt stood at $24.4 billion as of December, from $19.8 billion at end-2019, after the Bukele administration allocated millions of dollars to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effects over the past couple of years.

The International Monetary Fund estimates that the current account deficit for its remittance and external financing-reliant economy will hover near $2 billion through 2025.

But adopting bitcoin set the country at loggerheads with multilateral lenders like the IMF, from which Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya said last year the government was seeking $1.3 billion.

The fund has recommended that El Salvador ditch bitcoin altogether. Any deal for a credit line would have to address risks including ""those related to the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender as well as risks related to economic governance,"" an IMF official said on Wednesday.

Ratings agencies have warned bitcoin adoption could facilitate money laundering, and importantly, the bitcoin risk has given bond investors another reason to demand higher returns

As of Wednesday, they were seeking a record-high premium of 2,445 basis points over U.S. Treasuries (.JPMEGDELSR).

Bukele's moves to centralize power, from removing all the top judges on the country's supreme court to muscling through authorization to seek immediate re-election despite constitutional term limits, have helped drive the risk premium higher.

""If there isn't potential for bitcoin-growth dividends or innovative bitcoin-financing, then the Bukele administration will have to prioritize spending priorities and identify financing options,"" according to Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America Fixed Income Strategy at Amherst Pierpont.

Reuters calculations of a $36 million paper loss in bitcoin, enough to make at least some of those coupon payments, is based on Bukele's tweets and an estimate of prices on the purchase dates. The government has spent some $104.2 million on 2,301 coins now worth just $67.9 million using Wednesday's volume weighted average price.

The country has to service $329 million in interest due on its international bonds this year as well as $800 million in a bond set to mature in January.

ICEFI's Castaneda listed financing options including the Central American and Latin American development banks - CABEI and CAF, respectively - as possible patches for financing the $800 million payment due in January. Another option, he said, is to nationalize the country's pension fund to cover the fiscal deficit - which could be done by transferring the public's savings to a government account.

A debt restructuring for El Salvador is ""inevitable"" if the country continues with the ""current policy mix,"" said Polina Kurdyavko, head of emerging markets at BlueBay Asset Management. ""Debt in El Salvador could be sustainable with the right (IMF) program. But they have to act now.""

The country's finance minister, Zelaya, declined to comment for this story.

Salvadoran bonds trade between 43.5 cents and 34 cents on the dollar except for the January maturity at 75 cents, reflecting cautious optimism that the country could make that payment.

The cost to insure investors against a Salvadoran sovereign default over the next five years on Wednesday hit its highest level since 2020, according to S&P Global data.

75,3 Takeaways From Morningstars Conference for Fund Managers,2022-05-20 14:15:00,"It’s a tough time to be an investor. And the bad news keeps coming: Interest rates are rising, inflation is high, the war in Ukraine continues, China’s woes are deepening, and stocks and crypto are both crashing.

With turbulence and uncertainty writ large on the global stage, investors and financial advisors gathered in Chicago to discuss the outlook for markets and investing and where to find bargains. Here are three key points from the Morningstar Investment conference:

Love it or hate it, Bitcoin is here to stay

Last week, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunged, regaining a bit of ground this week. So what is the future of cryptocurrency?

Mark Casey, portfolio manager at Capital Group, said he has a paradoxical view. “Every project I studied in crypto seems like garbage to me, and it doesn’t really have a real reason to exist, other than Bitcoin, which I think could turn out to be one of the most important inventions in all of human history,” he said.

While he is optimistic about Bitcoin, he acknowledged that it is still in its early days. “I think it’s a very early invention. It’s very speculative and it could fail,” Casey said. At the same time, he added, “it’s a profoundly significant invention. I think it could be a big deal in the long term.”

As for where Bitcoin will trade in the future, Christopher Lin, portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments, said no one “has any clue of what the price of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is going to do over the next 1- 3- 5- 10 years with any sort of precision or accuracy.”

He said he is neither bullish nor bearish, “because that implies that I know what the price is going to do. I have no idea what the price is going to do. But I think the technology is extremely elegant and could be extraordinarily valuable as an evolution of software computing.”

Opportunities abound for ESG investors

The costs for clean energy solutions were “abysmal as recently as 10 years ago,” said Lucas White, portfolio manager at GMO. The technologies were so uncompetitive that they were only in use thanks to public policy support. Now, transformational changes in areas such as auto manufacturing, utilities, and water have created a heap of opportunities that no longer rely on government aid, he said.

While greenhouse-gas emissions grab most of the headlines when it comes to climate change, water is a looming risk for businesses and investors. Lisa Beauvilain, head of sustainability and ESG at Impax Asset Management, said water “is very important for climate solutions” because it “will be the manifestation of climate in many ways, too much, or too little.”

She looks at investing in water through three lenses: infrastructure, including pipes, valves and pumps; water treatment and recycling; and water utilities.

Ukraine has already beaten Russia

“Ukraine has already won this war,” said former U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation Michael McFaul. “Putin has failed in all his major objectives but one.”

Those objectives include reunifying Russia and Ukraine; “denazifying” Ukraine through regime change; demilitarization; seizing the capital Kyiv; and occupying the major cities in the east. Only progress in the eastern Donbas region appears possible at this point.

“Now [Russia] is down to changing the military objectives,” McFaul said. “It’s the defense of Donbas, the independence of Donbas. [Putin] has moved everything there to try to connect Crimea to Donbas.”

Putin has lost “the big war …but that doesn’t mean yet that he’s lost all the battles,” McFaul said, adding that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is “the Churchill of our time.”

As for what happens next, he said there were two relatively unlikely outcomes:

“I think it’s a low probability that Putin wins Donbas and pushes up to Kyiv. It isn’t zero,” he said. “One other low probability, but not zero, is that the Ukrainians push the Russians out of their country. I think that is higher than the first one.”

The most probable outcome, McFaul said, is that the fight in Donbas lasts “for several weeks, maybe months, where the borders don’t change that much, and then there are some very hard decisions that especially President Zelensky will have to make. Does he sign a cease-fire and agree to disagree about the borders or do they continue to fight?”

76,Stockmarket rout pushes SampP 500 into bearmarket territory Dow falls 500 points,2022-05-20 13:45:00,"U.S. stocks were sharply lower Friday afternoon, with the S&P 500 index slipping into bear-market territory and the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for its longest string of weekly losses in 90 years.

On Thursday, the Dow industrials and S&P 500 booked their lowest closes since March 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. For the week, the Dow is heading for a 4.6% drop, while the S&P 500 is on pace to fall 5% and the Nasdaq is poised to tumble 6.2%, FactSet data show, at last check.

What’s driving markets?

A close below 3,837.25 would confirm that the S&P 500 entered a bear market, marking a fall of 20% or more from its Jan. 3 record close.

Read: The S&P 500 is trading in bear-market territory. How far could it fall?

Wall Street initially took a cue from a strong Asian session, where the Hong Kong Hang Seng HSI, +2.96% ended about 3% higher and the China CSI 300 index 000300, +1.95% rose nearly 2%, but early gains Friday in the U.S. stock market proved fragile.

“Stocks remain on a shaky footing. Investors’ list of worries grows ever larger,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with City Index and Forex.com, in a note.

”Inflation. Interest-rate hikes. Low economic growth. Stagflation. Recession. Perhaps most importantly for stocks, the Fed is not there to provide cushion, like before,” he wrote.

Stocks were initially buoyed after the People’s Bank of China on Friday cut in its rate on five-year loans, aimed at shoring up weak housing sales by reducing mortgage costs. The country has been battling COVID outbreaks, with lockdowns in industrial hubs such as Shanghai blamed for weak factory and consumer activity data in April.

But analysts said the move also underlined concerns.

“Where the rest of the world is thinking of raising rates because of inflation, they’re cutting rates in order to help the economy,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for online brokerage firm tastytrade Inc., in a phone interview. “I think that’s a little bit of a warning sign,” as U.S. companies that benefit from demand in China may be hurt by a slowing Chinese economy as well as supply-chain disruptions linked to the country’s lockdowns, he said.

The S&P 500 traded into bear-market territory Friday afternoon, with all of its 11 sectors down, FactSet data show, at last check.

Friday is the final day of trading before the expiration of options tied to stocks and exchange-traded funds, which is seen potentially contributing to volatility ahead of the end of the session.

Major U.S. stock indexes remain on track for another week of losses, with investors worried about whether soaring inflation can be brought under control by the Federal Reserve without derailing the economy.

The Dow is heading for its eighth straight weekly decline, which would be its longest since April 1932, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were on track for a seventh straight weekly fall, the longest streak for each since 2001.

Major retailers this week, such as Walmart WMTand Target TGT reported disappointing profits, against a backdrop of rising expenses and inflation.

Mark Hulbert: Here’s the real reason the stock market is coming unglued — and it isn’t because of weak earnings

This past week has shown that the risk of economic downturn, fears that high inflation is cutting into corporate performance and rising borrowing costs remain the major worry for markets, particularly after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank “won’t hesitate” to lift rates beyond neutral to curb high inflation, according to Christian Stocker, lead equity sector strategist at UniCredit Bank in Munich.

“In this environment, investor sentiment is fickle and markets are likely to remain choppy to both sides until there is greater clarity in terms of recession, rates, and geopolitical risks,” Stocker said.

The U.S. economic data calendar is empty for Friday, but next week will bring another round of inflation data, personal consumption expenditure prices excluding food and energy.

77,Why did crypto crash Mark Cuban compares crypto lull to the early internet,2022-05-20 12:51:00,"Mark Cuban, billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, thinks that cryptocurrency is on the same downward trend that tech and internet companies hit in the early 2000s.

Bitcoin hit a 10-month low in May, and sales of non-fungible tokens, aka NFTs, plummeted between January and March 2022.

Cuban addressed the slump in a viral Twitter TWTR, +1.58% thread. “Crypto is going through the lull that the internet went through,” he wrote.

The comparison between cryptocurrency and the early days of the internet has been made by Cuban and others including entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk before. The dot-com bubble burst in 2000 after several internet-centric companies received high levels of investment speculation, only to eventually bottom-out.

Cuban sold his company Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for $5.7 billion, just before the dot-com bust. Broadcast.com has since been discontinued.

He claims to own several thousand dollars worth of bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.93% , ethereum ETHUSD, -3.44% and dogecoin DOGEUSD, -3.44% , according to a CNBC report, and also says that 80% of his investments that aren’t on “Shark Tank” are crypto-related.

But what’s next? While NFTs have exploded in popularity over the past few years, with creators like Beeple and NBA Top Shot selling NFTs for millions of dollars, recent NFT sales have plummeted as more creators flooded the marketplace. The average daily transaction volume on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, was down more than 55% from January 2022 to March 2022, according to crypto data tracking platform Dune Analytics.

“I think that early on, you saw lots of new entrants who were enthusiastic about this, but didn’t necessarily have a grasp of the fundamentals, and I think the cooling is a reflection of that,” Jordan Birnholtz, co-founder at NFT marketplace Neon told Distributed Ledger.

Millionaire Vaynerchuk, who invested early in companies like Facebook FB, +0.60% , Twitter, Uber UBER, -0.42% , Snap SNAP, -0.84% and Venmo, told MarketWatch in July 2021 that he, like Cuban, sees NFTs and crypto following similar paths as the early internet companies in the late 1990s.

“I view NFTs exactly the way I viewed the internet in 1999. Internet stocks and their valuations were through the roof, prematurely, and a lot of things collapsed. Meanwhile, eBay EBAY, -1.41% , Google GOOG, -2.39% and Amazon AMZN, -0.42% were all there,” Vaynerchuk said.

Cuban said somethings similar in a now-deleted tweet last January. “Watching the cryptos trade, it’s EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble. EXACTLY,” he wrote. “I think BTC, ETH, a few others will be analogous to those that were built during the dotcom era, survived the bubble bursting and thrived, like AMZN, EBay, and Priceline. Many won’t.”

Cuban’s latest crypto comments come as prices for many cryptocurrencies are plummeting. Prices for bitcoin and ether were hovering around roughly half their November peaks.

78,Crypto Exchange FTX Is Pushing Into Stocks But Whos Trading Anything,2022-05-20 12:24:00,"The U.S. arm of cryptocurrency exchange FTX is pushing into stocks, the latest sign that brokerages are gunning for a model that would allow retail investors to trade a more diverse array of assets at a time when volumes have fallen precipitously.

FTX.US has made equity trading available in a testing phase to a group of customers chosen from a wait list, the company said Thursday. Integrated with FTX’s crypto trading platform, FTX Stocks will allow users to buy and sell the likes of Apple (ticker: AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) stock as well as exchange-traded funds and hundreds of other U.S. securities alongside Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Fractional share trading will be allowed for some securities.

“Our goal is to offer a holistic investing service for our customers across all asset classes,” said FTX.US President Brett Harrison in a statement. “We have created a single integrated platform for retail investors to easily trade crypto, NFTs, and traditional stock offerings through a transparent and intuitive user interface.”

FTX.US said it won’t receive payment for order flow—a controversial way that brokers such as Robinhood Markets (HOOD) subsidize free trading by routing orders through third-party trading firms instead of stock exchanges. Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX’s co-founder and chief executive, has taken a 7.6% stake in Robinhood, according to regulatory filings earlier this month.

“There is clear market demand for a new retail investment experience that offers full order routing transparency to customers and does not rely on payment for order flow,” Harrison said.

FTX.US bucks the trend of traditional finance brokerages moving into cryptocurrencies. Robinhood rolled out crypto trading to more than two million users in April, and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is making a similar push into the world of digital assets.

Instead, with FTX, a crypto-native firm is moving into traditional finance.It isn’t the first time: FTX took a stake in IEX Group, the operator of a U.S.-regulated equities exchange, last month.

The convergence of traditional finance and crypto-native firms on trading platforms that allow users to buy and sell both equities and digital assets comes as trading volumes—both in stocks and cryptos—have taken a dive.

Amid the broad selloff in markets in 2022, retail traders seem to be staying put. The S&P 500 has tumbled almost 19% so far this year while the price of Bitcoin has declined closer to 40%.

This has manifested in trouble for brokers. Robinhood has announced plans to cut 9% of its staff amid a slowdown revealed in its quarterly earnings last month. Management reported a 10% fall in monthly active users on an annual basis. Robinhood stock is down 44% this year.

It has been even worse in the crypto world, where leading exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) reported a loss of $1.98 per share in the first quarter, far below the 1-cent loss forecast by Wall Street. Trading volumes at Coinbase plunged to $309 billion in the first quarter of the year, down 8% from the year prior and 44% below levels in the final period of 2021. Coinbase stock has tumbled 73% so far in 2022.

And there are reasons to believe things might get worse for Coinbase—and potentially others in the crypto world—as digital asset prices continue to slide. Coinbase didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Barron’s on whether the company was considering an expansion into stock trading.

Analysts led by Dan Dolev at Mizuho Securities wrote in a note Thursday that they estimated after a survey that the average Bitcoin holder’s cost basis is $21,000; the largest digital asset was changing hands around $30,000 on Thursday.

“If true, this means that the more Bitcoin nears such levels, the closer the average investor gets to the break-even point,” the analysts wrote. “What is the tipping point that could trigger investors to liquidate Bitcoin?” Their survey suggested the figure would be around $9,000.

Broad-based, large-scale Bitcoin sales could see a wave of retail traders leave Coinbase’s platform, hurting the company. But a note of optimism, Dolev noted, was that nearly 50% of those surveyed reported no intention to sell Bitcoin irrespective of how low it goes.

Mizuho rates Coinbase at Neutral with a price target of $60. Late Thursday afternoon, the stock was a bit below $67.

But it’s on track to be down for seven straight weeks — the first time since 2002, when it fell for eight consecutive weeks.

Plus the consumer discretionary sector, which includes most retailers, took a 7.6% hit. That includes a 29% plunge for Target TGT, +1.22% . Walmart TGT, +1.22% fared a bit better; its stock slumped 19% for the week following its own report of declining earnings. Both companies felt the squeeze from bulging inventories.

Here’s deeper coverage of retail earnings reports this week, including changes in consumer spending patterns, from Tonya Garcia:

Tesla TSLA, -8.38% CEO Elon Musk continues to wrangle with Twitter’s TWTR, +1.58% board of directors over how many of the social-media company’s user accounts might be fake. The drama may be Musk’s basis for negotiating a lower price than his original offer of $54.20 a share for Twitter. Investors don’t expect the deal in its current form to be completed, with Twitter’s shares closing at only $37.29 on May 19.

But Musk’s gambit may cost him much more than a $1 billion breakup fee if he walks away from Twitter.

Shares of Tesla have fallen 28% since April 12, the day before Musk made his offer to Twitter’s board to take the company private. On May 19, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who continues to rate Tesla’s stock “outperform,” cut his price target for the shares by 40% to $1,000. Tesla’s stock closed at $709.42 on May 19.

80,Despite donations from a crypto billionaire Carrick Flynn loses Oregon primary,2022-05-20 10:32:00,"Despite nearly $11 million in donations from FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Democratic House candidate Carrick Flynn lost his Oregon primary race.

Early Wednesday, Flynn conceded to state Rep. Andrea Salinas, a three-term state lawmaker who is looking to become Oregon’s first Hispanic woman in Congress. The seat they were running for was in Oregon’s 6th Congressional district, which stretches from Salem to the Portland area. The area is leans Democratic, and a primary win is a good indicator for general election success in November — the district has a Democratic lean of 7 percentage points, according to FiveThirtyEight’s redistricting map.

Through his super PAC called Protect Our Future, Bankman-Fried spent money on TV ads, radio ads and direct mail services on Flynn’s behalf, making the Oregon-6 primary race the third most expensive House Democratic primary of this election cycle.

Bankman-Fried, who is 30 years old and worth almost $22 billion, donated to Flynn because of Flynn’s interest in pandemic preparedness, he told the New York Times — Flynn claims to have studied pandemics and disaster prevention at the University of Oxford.

Flynn received roughly 19% of the total vote, half of what winner Andrea Salinas received, according to the latest tally from the Washington Post. About 72% of the vote has been counted, but the race has already been called.

82,States with legal sports betting Americans bet 125 billion since legalization,2022-05-20 09:38:00,"Over the weekend, Americans celebrated the four-year anniversary since the Supreme Court ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) doesn’t make sports gambling a federal crime, clearing the way for individual states to offer legal wagering.

After the Supreme Court ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act doesn’t make sports gambling a federal crime

Since the ban was lifted, Americans have bet more than $125 billion on sports — as of May, 30 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. now offer some form of legalized sports betting, according to the latest tally from the American Gaming Association.

In just four years, betting transformed from a taboo topic on sports television to the open discussion of gambling odds during halftime shows of games.

Ray Lesniak, the now-retired state senator from New Jersey who filed the first lawsuit against the federal government in an effort to legalize sports betting, said he acted to provide money for states, and protect consumers.

“I made a good bet for New Jersey and for America,” he told the Associated Press, metaphorically speaking.

New Jersey is routinely one of the states with the most money wagered on sports each month, frequently passing long-time betting hub Nevada for the top spot on the list.

Over $1 billion was legally wagered on this year’s Super Bowl, and about $3 billion was estimated to be wagered during this year’s March Madness college basketball tournament, both numbers more than doubled totals from the year before.

“When PASPA was repealed, I don’t think any of us would have expected how big the industry would be just four short years later,” Karol Corcoran, general manager of FanDuel’s online sportsbook, told the AP.

“It would have seemed impossible just a few years ago to reach such height,” Dustin Gouker, lead analyst for PlayUSA.com, wrote to MarketWatch in an email. “But with the expansion of sports betting over the past year it is inevitable that legal wagering will soar.”

DraftKings president and co-founder Matt Kalish said: “I got into this industry because I was always the kind of kid who liked to predict things, to compete with my friends and make predictions. For people that like to do that, sports betting has become far and away the No. 1 thing.”

The $125 billion wagered figure is nearly three times how much Elon Musk agreed to buy Twitter TWTR, +1.56% for, and represents a bigger number than the total market cap for technology giant IBM IBM, -1.59% . In layman’s terms, it’s a lot of money.

After expenses, sportsbooks generally keep less than 10% of the total amount of bets they handle. Over the first four years of legal betting, their revenue figure is $8.8 billion, according to the American Gaming Association (AGA).

A major rationale for the push to legalize sports betting was to protect customers from being victimized by unlicensed bookmakers, particualary those who operate outside the U.S. State regulations include robust consumer protections, with watchdog regulators ready to pounce when they see violations.

Sports betting has been, and still is, pitched to state lawmakers as a source of new tax revenue, a particularly tempting option in the trying financial times of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has generated $1.3 billion in state and local taxes since 2018 according to the AGA, but the amount many states keep is a mere drop in the bucket compared with their overall budget. Some states, like New York, tax mobile sports betting revenue at 51% — a rate that operators say is not sustainable in the long run. DraftKings CEO Jason Robins even posited that the introduction of sports betting to California could help address problems surrounding “homelessness and mental health.”

Bettors who used sportsbooks like DraftKings DKNG, -2.93% , Caesars CZR, +1.40% or FanDuel had limited betting options when legal wagering was first introduced — like picking the outcome of a game or player performance before the event started. Since then, the array of potential bets has spiked due in large part to a surge in live-game betting, where gamblers can react to events as a game unfolds and bet accordingly.

“The live-betting has been pretty popular since day one,” former FanDuel CEO Matthew King told MarketWatch in 2021 shortly after the product debuted.

And while the more established sportsbooks look to increase their share of the market, the amount of money it takes to enter the industry and compete continues to grow, to the point where many executives of leading companies say they expect some lesser competitors to either merge or stop doing business.

FanDuel’s Corcoran said the near-term future is about growing the industry and its individual companies.

“We feel fortunate to have access to about 38% of the American population,” he said. “But there are still millions of people that don’t yet have legal sports betting. We’d love to be able to operate where they are.”

83,Bitcoin Is Rising Crypto Traders Are Still Preparing for the Worst,2022-05-20 08:41:00,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were rallying on Friday as digital assets continued a recent outperformance of stocks, though there are signs in the derivatives market that crypto traders are preparing for a move downward.

The price of Bitcoin rose 4% over the past 24 hours to around $30,500. The largest crypto was still trading around the lowest point all year, but comfortably higher than recent levels below $30,000 and well above near $26,000 low reached in last week’s cryptocurrency crash.

“Bitcoin is hovering around the $30,000 level as investors continue to shy away from stocks,” wrote Edward Moya, an analyst at broker Oanda. “A weaker dollar and bear market stock fears are making Bitcoin attractive again.”

Bitcoin and its peers should theoretically trade independently of mainstream financial markets, but have largely shown themselves to be correlated with other risk-sensitive assets—like stocks, and especially tech stocks—over the past year. Some of that correlation has recently faded, with Bitcoin actually outperforming stock indexes like the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq this week.

The leading digital asset has gained almost 10% since Monday, when it changed hands around $29,500. By comparison, based on stock-index futures indicating the U.S. market open on Friday, the S&P 500 has lost 2% this week while the Nasdaq-100 is down 3%.

Stocks are in a rough patch, with the Nasdaq remaining deep in bear market territory—down 28% this year—and the S&P 500 flirting with a bear market.

“Bitcoin looks poised to consolidate [around $30,000], but bulls should be happy to see prices are not mimicking what happens with the stock market,” Moya wrote.

Bitcoin is trading at its lowest levels since July 2021, and remains at less than half its all-time high near $69,000 reached in November. By comparison, the S&P 500 closed on Thursday at its lowest level since March 2021.

The leading digital asset is recovering ever-so slowly from its recent crash, which was largely linked to spillover from a stock market selloff and fueled by the collapse of a systemically-important stablecoin meant to be pegged to the U.S. dollar.

“It seems the fallout from all the stablecoin drama that sent cryptos sharply lower is finally fading,” wrote Moya.

That stablecoin, TerraUSD, continued to trade at a severe discount to the dollar—7 cents. Luna, a related token that through an arbitrage market mechanism is meant to keep Terra on its peg, was changing hands at one-hundredth of a penny. It was at $80 two weeks ago, when it was one of the largest digital assets.

But there remain indications in the derivatives market that crypto traders are readying for—or even betting on—another major downward move in Bitcoin prices.

“The put/call ratio for Bitcoin open interest hit a 12-month high of 0.72 yesterday, indicating bearish sentiment among investors,” wrote a team at crypto market intelligence firm Delphi Digital.

A put/call ratio describes the environment of bets in the options market; puts are bets on prices moving lower, while calls are bets that prices will jump.

“A high put/call ratio indicates that investors are speculating whether bitcoin will continue to sell off, or it could mean investors are hedging their portfolios against a downward move,” the analysts at Delphi said. “Last April, the put/call ratio traded as high as 0.96 before Bitcoin’s price dropped over 50% in May 2021.”

Beyond Bitcoin, the crypto Ether was even more buoyant. The token underpinning the Ethereum blockchain network rose 5% to above $2,050, well above last week’s trough below $1,800, but still down by nearly one-third from two weeks ago.

Smaller cryptos, or altcoins, also gained. Solana rose 4%, Cardano was up 2%, and Avalanche jumped 7%. Memecoins, which were initially intended as internet jokes rather than serious cryptocurrency prospects, were similarly in the green; Dogecoin and Shiba Inu both rallied 2%.

84,4 tricks for saving money on a family vacation,2022-05-20 05:02:00,"This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet.

My family didn’t travel much when I was a kid, but when we did, my parents jumped through hoops to cut costs.

On a trip to Disney World, DIS, -1.37% for example, our family of six switched hotels. Every. Night. My mom worked for a hotel chain and could get one free night per property.

Did my parents save money? Yes. Did it add to the mental burden of traveling with four kids? Absolutely.

As an adult now, planning a trip with my own child, I fully understand how expensive — and hard — it is to travel with kids. Planning and packing requires accounting for naps, snacks, tantrums and blowouts. And you’re budgeting for extra airfare, a bigger rental car and additional lodging.

You can save money on family travel and still have peace of mind. To find out how, I consulted two experts. Here’s what they had to say.

Pay with points

The secret of savvy travelers? They don’t actually pay for airfare and lodging. Instead, they use rewards credit cards to turn everyday purchases into free flights and hotel rooms.

“Make your money work for you,” says Preethi Harbuck, a San Francisco Bay Area-based travel writer behind the blog Local Passport Family. Harbuck’s family of seven (soon to be eight) travels almost exclusively on credit card points. “There are more expenditures when you have kids but you can leverage those into greater benefits.”

Card hopping can net you major points thanks to signup bonuses but can be hard to manage, says Jamie Harper, mother of four and author of the travel blog Fly by the Seat of Our Pants. To keep things manageable, stick to one or two primary cards.

Harper and her husband rotate between Hyatt, H, -2.75% Marriott MAR, -1.92% and Hilton HLT, -1.46% cards, which offer perks like free breakfast, Wi-Fi and anniversary nights.

Pack light — and smart

Overpacking can be a disaster on multiple fronts. First, you have to lug all that stuff with you and keep track of it along the way. The odds of a lost blankie are high.

Second, checked bags are expensive — around $30 to $35 per bag, each way.

Harbuck and her family stick to either one checked bag or a few smaller carry-ons. Rather than a fresh outfit for each person, each day, they rewear outfits and typically do laundry on each trip.

“Pack clothing that’s lightweight, packs up well and dries quickly,” she says, noting that wool items are great for colder weather.

Having layers is crucial, too. Skimp on this and you may wind up spending $50 per kid on souvenir sweatshirts to keep them warm, Harper says.

Choose activities mindfully

Pack your itinerary with free things to do, like local parks, hikes, beaches or free museums.

You can also tap into perks included with memberships you already have — to your local zoo or children’s museum — or invest in passes that you can use again and again.

When you do pay for experiences and excursions, consider your family’s life stage. Rather than taking your toddler to an art museum, for example, opt for an outdoor sculpture garden where they can run around or a museum tailored toward children with plenty of interactive features at their level.

Your family’s travel priorities should also guide you, Harbuck says. Learning about a place’s culture and history is important for her family, so they spend money on activities that achieve that goal and skip more popular tourist attractions.

“We’ve been to London several times but have never ridden the London Eye,” she says. “It doesn’t help me feel connected to the culture, and it’s super expensive.”

Pack snacks, grocery shop

There’s no rule that says you have to dine out for every meal when you’re on vacation.

Instead, pick one meal a day to eat out. Lunch is a good option, as it’s typically cheaper than dinner (which in some countries starts later than most kids’ bedtimes). By packing your supper or eating at home, you avoid an overpriced meal where children are either melting down or asleep at the table.

Harbuck’s family hits up local markets to stock up on food when they land in a new city. Taking a road trip? Keep a cooler with food for rest-stop picnics.

“If we don’t eat out twice, we’re saving $100 a day — and that’s the cheapest possible meal,” Harper says, noting her kids are picky eaters. “We spent $7 per kid on buttered pasta once. It was the worst experience ever. They didn’t even eat it.”

85,How TerraUSD a Digital Token Designed to be Stable Fueled a Crypto Crash,2022-05-19 21:05:00,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies went from bad to worse as selling pressure spread across the tech landscape. But the latest crypto crash was also fueled by stablecoins, a type of token that’s supposed to hold up when everything else tanks.

Stablecoins are designed to maintain a fixed value, typically at $1 per token. But a fast-growing “algorithmic” stablecoin called TerraUSD collapsed this past week to a few pennies on the dollar. That appears to have shaken confidence in the largest stablecoin, Tether. Prices for Tether, or USDT, dipped to 95 cents for a few hours on Thursday, then rebounded to nearly a dollar.

The episode could shake the foundations of crypto. Stablecoins are the bedrock of trading and lending activities, providing liquidity to individual traders, funds, and market makers on both centralized exchanges and decentralized-finance, or DeFi, networks. More than 90% of trading volume in crypto occurs in stablecoins, according to CoinMarketCap. Without stablecoins doing their job—holding their dollar pegs through periods of extreme turmoil—the crypto market may face a loss of confidence, affecting trading activity and prices for tokens ranging from Bitcoin to Dogecoin.

“USDT de-pegging is alarming for all cryptocurrency markets,” says Clara Medalie, research director at Kaiko, a crypto data firm.

This isn’t just a concern for traders and firms in the $1.3 trillion crypto market. Regulators worry that if stablecoins take off as privately issued digital money, they could pose risks to broader markets and monetary policies. A run on a stablecoin could, in theory, lead to heavy selling in assets held as reserves for coin issuers, such as commercial short-term debt. Stablecoins could also substitute for the dollar in international commerce and cross-border payments—making it harder for governments to keep tabs on monetary policies and capital flows.

“The outstanding stock of stablecoins is growing at a very rapid rate, and we really need a consistent federal framework,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, partly in reference to TerraUSD.

Bitcoin’s high volatility and drawbacks as a medium of exchange opened a door for stablecoins to step through. Tether and USD Coin, or USDC, have soared in issuance over the past few years. They’re now worth a combined $130 billion, making them the third- and fourth-largest cryptos, behind Bitcoin and Ether.

“Once you’re in the ecosystem, stablecoins allow you to act as though you have U.S. dollars, when really you own crypto,” says Stéphane Ouellette, CEO of crypto derivatives broker FRNT Financial.

The coins serve numerous purposes: Traders use them to maintain liquidity between transactions and to buy other cryptos; they also play a key role in market-making and are widely used by hedge funds and other proprietary trading firms. Tether, in particular, is the most systemically important; it’s the basis for thousands of “pair trades” on exchanges and DeFi platforms, along with “smart contracts” for lending and borrowing cryptos.

Demand for stablecoins is so high as collateral for trading and borrowing that yields top 8% on many DeFi platforms and centralized sites—and even touched 20% for TerraUSD.

There’s also profit in stablecoins, and it’s attracting banks, payment companies, and fintechs to the space. The bank Silvergate Capital (ticker: SI) aims to revive the stablecoin project originally started by Meta Platforms ’ (FB) Facebook, part of a broad push into crypto banking and brokerage products. Visa (V) is offering settlement services in USDC. The company backing USDC, Circle Internet Financial, is trying to go public via a special-purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC, called Concord Acquisition (CND). Recent investors in Circle include BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity Investments.

The New Crypto Dollars

Like every other cryptocurrency, stablecoin transactions are recorded on blockchains such as Ethereum. While transaction fees may be steep, the coins are well suited for peer-to-peer transfers that bypass traditional banking systems, cutting out intermediaries. That’s one reason they’re often used for remittances or cross-border payments. Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv began welcoming crypto donations in three tokens, including Tether.

There are basically two kinds of stablecoins: asset-backed and algorithmic. Tether and USDC are the two largest asset-backed coins. The companies backing the coins aim to maintain their pegs by holding reserves equivalent to their outstanding issuance. Every time a dollar’s worth of the coins is minted, the companies are supposed to buy a dollar’s worth of reserves; when the coins are redeemed, those reserves may be sold.

Algorithmic coins like TerraUSD are more complex. They aim to maintain their pegs through arbitrage and incentive mechanisms involving other cryptocurrencies. When the price deviates from a dollar, traders can profit through a swap with another token. That is supposed to prevent the price of the stablecoin from deviating much above or below a dollar.

Breaking the Buck

TerraUSD relied on a complex mechanism of minting and burning another token, LUNA, to maintain its dollar peg. A cascade of selling in TerraUSD destabilized its peg, however, and crashed prices for LUNA.

Crypto entrepreneur Do Kwon, based in Korea, had tried to shore up LUNA and TerraUSD with plans to purchase up to $10 billion worth of Bitcoin as collateral through the “Luna Foundation Guard.” Before the crash, the foundation held $3.5 billion in Bitcoin.

The selling pressure arose from withdrawals on a DeFi lending protocol called Anchor that offered yields of 20% on TerraUSD deposits. Roughly $14 billion worth of TerraUSD was deposited in Anchor before the crash. Less than $200 million is left.

“I understand the last 72 hours have been extremely tough on all of you—know that I am resolved to work with every one of you to weather this crisis, and we will build our way out of this,” Kwon said on Twitter on Wednesday. “As we begin to rebuild [Terra], we will adjust its mechanism to be collateralized.”

Still, the Luna Foundation Guard may be running out of money. Its reserves are down to less than $90 million worth of cryptos, and it holds no Bitcoin in its wallet. The crash also took a toll on the Terra blockchain, which briefly shut down on Thursday “to prevent governance attacks,” according to Terra’s Twitter feed. The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, also suspended trading in TerraUSD and LUNA.

Some crypto participants say that while the episode has been painful, it signals that the market is actually functioning. “The market flushed out a weakly designed system, and the speculators that were behind it took a financial hit,” says Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto data firm Messari.

Yet the crash had contagion effects. Luna’s stockpiling of Bitcoin rippled across other cryptos. Traders expecting a meltdown in TerraUSD appear to have sold Bitcoin, contributing to the token’s declines. That, in turn, weakened demand across crypto markets, which lost more than $400 billion in market cap as scores of tokens declined by more than 20%, including Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, and Solana.

USDT hasn’t emerged without a black eye, either, underscoring how contagion from one crypto can spread to others and the broader market.

In theory, USDT shouldn’t deviate far from its peg. Tether Ltd., the company backing the token, says USDT is “backed 100%” by reserves at a one-to-one ratio, and promises that investors can always redeem its tokens for an equivalent amount of real money. If a hedge fund were to send the company one million USDT tokens, for instance, the company would send the fund $1 million, even if the price differs on secondary markets.

The token also relies on arbitrage mechanisms with market makers and trading firms to hold its peg. If the price of USDT falls by even a fraction of a penny on exchanges like Coinbase or FTX, institutional traders can buy USDT at a discount and redeem it with the company, profiting off the spread, or difference, to a buck.

Those mechanics do appear to have worked. The coin was at about 95 cents on the dollar at 3:30 a.m. in New York on Thursday, but by 9 a.m. it was above 99 cents.

Why did the price get so low? Overnight selling pressure before banks opened for business may have contributed—leaving a gap between selling on the secondary market and redemptions with Tether. Moreover, Tether redeems tokens only with “eligible contract participants” such as proprietary trading firms, and it isn’t automatic.

Some market participants say USDT’s loss of dollar peg wasn’t a deal breaker for the token. “The market is functioning, and it’s expected to see minor de-risking of other stablecoins following the Terra de-peg,” says John Kramer, director of trading at market maker GSR.

Ouellette, who deals in Tether through his derivatives firm and a separate hedge fund, describes the situation as a “little spooky,” but adds that it looked like typical “arbitrage friction,” exacerbated by hedge funds that had tried to attack USDT and profit off a decline.

Still, Tether hasn’t inspired confidence with its limited disclosures and reserve practices. Based in the British Virgin Islands, Tether issues a periodic “assurance opinion” on its reserves from a Cayman Islands auditor. The last one was from December. In it, Tether said that 84% of its reserves were in cash and equivalents, Treasuries, short-term deposits, and commercial paper. The rest consisted of $4.1 billion in “secured loans”; $3.6 billion in “corporate bonds, funds, and precious metals”; and $5 billion in “other investments,” including “digital tokens.”

The company said Thursday that it had reduced its holdings of commercial paper by 50% over the past six months, and now holds the majority of its assets in Treasuries.

Still, Tether has run into legal troubles, settling charges last year with New York state and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over its reserves and disclosure practices.

“Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, Tether holds a strong, conservative, and liquid portfolio,” a Tether spokesperson tells Barron’s. Tether has maintained its stability “through multiple black-swan events” and never refused a redemption, the spokesperson adds. Tether added in a statement that “it is business as usual” and was processing more than $2 billion in redemption requests “without issue.”

Crypto Rules Are Coming

The volatility in stablecoins may only build momentum to bring some rules and supervision to the space.

The Biden administration, for one, wants coin issuers under federal supervision, potentially even carrying FDIC deposit insurance. Biden called on Congress to pass supervisory rules for stablecoins in a recent executive order on crypto.

Congress is also working on a variety of rules for stablecoins; a draft bill in the Senate would establish a process for banks and credit unions to issue stablecoins, among other measures. Sen. Patrick Toomey (R., Pa.) recently introduced a framework for regulating “payment stablecoins,” though it wouldn’t address algorithmic coins, which are looking far less stable than asset-backed coins.

U.S. regulators and lawmakers have expressed several concerns. One is about the liquidity and quality of issuers’ reserve assets—whether they can readily meet redemption requests in a panic scenario. Another growing concern is contagion to broader financial markets if there’s a run on a major stablecoin like USDT.

Many trading firms hold large amounts of USDT for market-making and liquidity. Those institutions need to be confident that USDT is fully backed and that they’ll be fully repaid in dollars when redeeming large amounts. “I don’t know too many institutional market participants that are concerned about the reserves in Tether,” says Selkis.

Yet if those trading firms were to lose faith in Tether, they may quickly try to sell their holdings on secondary markets. Without a government backstop like the Fed or Treasury Department, USDT would be at the mercy of the market, potentially causing shockwaves to other cryptos and trading at brokerages from Coinbase Global (COIN) to PayPal Holdings (PYPL).

“If you’re a regulator, I think what they’re worried about is not that the crypto community goes poof; it’s that the losses at Coinbase then feed to PayPal and then feed to a bank,” says Bryan Routledge, a professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University.

Stability Is All Relative

If anyone might emerge stronger from this, it’s Circle, the company backing USDC. Based in the U.S., Circle says its reserves now consist of cash and Treasuries, fully backing every token.

CEO Jeremy Allaire said on Thursday that the company had issued $1 billion in USDC over the prior 24 hours, which he attributed to a “flight to quality” as investors sought issuers that were fully backed and transparent. “There are others that have chosen not to participate in a regulatory framework,” he said. “Naturally, there are more questions about that.”

Circle, of course, is trying to be a model citizen as it aims to go public. Its revenue model centers partly on generating income from reserve assets and lending activities. Rising interest rates should boost the yield on its reserves. The firm is awaiting regulatory approval for its SPAC merger from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allaire said he expects the merger to be completed later this year.

Circle probably won’t be profitable for at least another year, though. It’s projecting adjusted operating profits of $677 million in 2023, assuming that USDC in circulation reaches $220 billion, with 5,000 institutional accounts and $6.4 billion in lending volume. More shocks to the crypto ecosystem would probably derail those plans, and Circle’s profits.

86,A Major Stablecoin Issuer Aims to Go Public The Crypto Crash Will Make It Tougher,2022-05-19 18:58:00,"Circle Internet Financial, backer of the “stablecoin” USD Coin, says it remains committed to its $9 billion merger with Concord Acquisition.

But getting the deal through the Securities and Exchange Commission is turning into a long and arduous slog, and the crypto market crash may only be making it tougher.

Stablecoins are digital tokens typically pegged to a dollar and backed by reserve assets. USD Coin, or USDC, is the second-largest stablecoin on the market, after Tether, worth $52 billion in outstanding issuance.

Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s co-founder and CEO, said on Wednesday that he had initially thought a merger with Concord (ticker: CND), a special-purpose acquisition company, would take six to eight months. Circle announced the deal with Concord in July 2021, valuing the fintech at $4.5 billion.

Ten months later, the SPAC merger is still awaiting regulatory approval at the SEC. In the meantime, Circle agreed to revised terms with Concord that boosted the fintech’s enterprise value to $9 billion.

Circle and Concord now have until Dec. 8 to complete the merger, with the potential to extend that date to Jan. 31, 2023.

If the deal falls apart, it would hardly be the only one dying in this market. The number of busted de-SPACs–where a blank-check company agrees to a merger with a business but then terminates the deal–has increased this year to about 20, according to data from SPAC Research. This is up from 19 terminated deals in all of 2021.

Allaire said Circle is still all-in on the merger, adding that it’s “a complex business, a new type of financial platform.” The company is moving through the process with the SEC, he added, providing no further insight into timing. Circle is also seeking a federal bank charter.

USD Coin’s issuance has rocketed 262% over the past 12 months, making it the fourth largest token by market value, after Bitcoin, Ether, and Tether. It’s widely used for liquidity in crypto markets, held by brokerages, hedge funds, and individual traders. It also serves as collateral for borrowing on decentralized-finance or DeFi platforms.

Circle isn’t yet profitable, according to its regulatory filings. But the company is projecting adjusted operating profits of $677 million in 2023, assuming that USD Coin in circulation reaches $220 billion, with 5,000 monthly active customers and $6.4 billion in lending volume

Some of the slowdown at the SEC may be due to more scrutiny of SPAC deals overall. Accounting guidance issued by the SEC in 2020 changed how SPACs handle warrants. The regulator also proposed new regulations this past March that would make the disclosures and obligations around SPACs more like those of an IPO. SPACs, under the proposed rules, will have to disclose details about sponsors’ compensation and potential conflicts of interest.

This year, just 66 SPACs have gone public as of May 11, valued at $11.4 billion, according to Dealogic. This compares to 315 blank check companies that collected $102 billion for the same time period in 2021.

But the crypto crash and collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin may only make the SEC even more reluctant to approve Circle’s merger with Concord.

Stablecoin rules are likely to emerge in Washington, either through bills now in Congress or orders from the Biden administration.

“We are now working with Congress to advance legislation to help ensure stablecoins are resilient to risks that could endanger consumers or the broader financial system,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a recent speech.

Were the SEC to give Circle a greenlight, it could be viewed as a seal of regulatory approval–something that isn’t likely under the SEC’s Democratic Chair Gary Gensler, who has been critical of cryptos and called for tougher rules. In April, Gensler said the agency plans to exercise more oversight of the crypto market and warned that stablecoins are so critical “that a loss of the peg or a failure of the issuer could imperil one or more trading platforms, and may reverberate across the wider crypto ecosystem.”

Allaire said Circle has benefited from the TerraUSD collapse and a brief spell of Tether losing its dollar peg. Circle’s outstanding issuance picked up 7% in the wake of those events, while Tether’s issuance has fallen by around $9 billion.

Terra and “that whole ecosystem was a source of froth,” Allaire said. “Our view was this was a house of cards,” he added, saying a “flight to quality has taken place.”

Whether the SEC agrees with that sentiment remains to be seen. An SEC spokesman declined to comment.

87,Crypto crash will have limited impact on US household wealth and labor supply Goldman Sachs,2022-05-19 17:42:00,"The global cryptocurrency market lost over $300 billion last week and about $1.7 trillion in the past seven months. But the impact on U.S. household wealth, spending and the labor supply are likely to be limited, according to Goldman Sachs.

The crypto market capitalization has plunged to around $1.3 trillion as of Thursday, from an all-time high of more than $3 trillion in November, according to CoinGecko.

U.S. households own about one-third of the global crypto market, or about $423 billion as of Thursday, according to the rough estimate by analysts at Goldman Sachs, based on various surveys. The recent decline in the crypto market is “very small” relative to U.S. households’ net worth, which stood at $150 trillion in 2021, the bank’s analysts wrote in a Thursday note.

Crypto holdings account for only 0.3% of U.S. households’ net worth, while the recent price drop of digital assets have reduced U.S. household wealth by about $300 billion, according to the analysts. In contrast, corporate equities account for about 33% of households’ net worth at the end of 2021, while their recent losses have likely erased $8 trillion of that wealth.

“These patterns imply that equity price fluctuations are the main driver of changes in household net worth, while cryptocurrencies are only a marginal contributor,” the analysts wrote.

Therefore, a decrease in cryptocurrencies’ value would have a minor impact on the aggregate spending, according to the report.

The analysts also expect the crypto downturn to have a limited effect on labor supply.

In general, the decline in household wealth may incentivize some workers who left the labor market during the pandemic to return, they noted.

However, crypto investors are predominantly young males, a demographic group whose labor-force participation has been less affected by wealth fluctuations, the analysts wrote. Meanwhile, the labor-force participation rate of young males has already returned to pre-pandemic level, Goldman said.

The analysis indicates that the wealth generated from cryptocurrency has likely played an insignificant role in discouraging labor supply, thus the recent fall in its price will provide a limited boost to labor supply.

88,Dow SampP 500 and Nasdaq end with backto back losses following worst day in about 2 years,2022-05-19 16:34:00,"U.S. stocks gave up earlier gains to end lower Thursday, following the worst slide in nearly two years for the S&P 500 index in the previous session, leaving it down almost 19% from its record, or close to a bear market.

On Wednesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1,165 points, or 3.6%, the S&P 500 declined 4%, and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 4.7%. The drop on Wednesday for the Dow and S&P 500 was the most since June 11, 2020.

What drove markets

The S&P 500 finished closer to bear-market territory as the Russia-Ukraine war, a slowdown in China’s economy, high inflation and rising interest rates cause investors to worry about corporate profits and economic growth.

“It’s kind of a piling on,” said Joe Quinlan, head of chief investment office market strategy at Merrill and Bank of America Private Bank, by phone. With retailers reporting the pinch of higher costs, questions have begun to percolate around if the U.S. could have a recession sooner than later.

“Retail cuts right at the heart of what drives the U.S. economy, i.e. consumers,” Quinlan said, adding that while the savings rate has come down from pandemic highs, the employment picture remains strong, even as it has gotten harder for many households to meet their energy and rent bills.

Stocks have been choppy since Wednesday’s disappointing results from Target Corp. TGT, +1.24% . Its earnings miss, a day after rival retailer Walmart WMT, -0.08% also disappointed with its quarterly results, unnerved investors already rattled by the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate-hike campaign.

“We are at washed-out sentiment levels,” said Matt Stucky, senior portfolio manager at Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management, by phone. While he pointed to signs of some stability for equities on Thursday, he also talked of concerns about a potential economic slowdown as the S&P 500 moves closer to a bear market, or a drop of at least 20% from its last peak.

“Right now, we are still thinking that things are likely to continue to slow, in term of growth, but avoid a recession,” Stucky said, while noting that consumers have been switching to spending on services, over goods, catching big retailers off guard. Credit markets, which typically sniff out an economic slowdown before stocks, also haven’t been flashing clear warning signs yet, he said.

Shares of retailer Kohl’s Corp. KSS closed 4.4% higher, after reporting a wide miss on profit and sales, following an 11% drop amid the retailer rout on Wednesday.

Analysts noted that Target’s results showed consumers moving away from stay-at-home goods like furniture and televisions. The U.S. retail sales report released this week showed spending at bars and restaurants up nearly 20% from year-earlier levels, or more than double the overall retail spending rate.

In U.S. economic data Thursday, first-time claims for unemployment benefits rose 21,000 last week to 218,000. The Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s regional manufacturing index dropped sharply to 2.6 in May, a two-year low, from 17.6 a month earlier.

Existing-home sales fell 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.61 million in April, the National Association of Realtors said Thursday. Compared with April 2021, home sales were down 5.9%. Economists polled by The Wall Street Journal had expected a decrease to 5.64 million units.

Seven weeks in red

Investors are watching bitcoin’s close for this week, after the cryptocurrency posted seven consecutive weeks in losses, the first time in its 13 years of history.

A close above $32,000 “will technically be a bullish signal and could be

a sign of reversal,” according to a Monday note by Arcane research.

I’ve written more about what metrics are being watched here.

Less leverage

Compared with previous drawdowns, the forced liquidations of overleveraged bitcoin futures positions have been light, indicating a lower amount of leverage in the market, analysts at bitcoin company NYDIG wrote in a Thursday note.

“These low bitcoin futures liquidations are consistent with data we see elsewhere; leverage in bitcoin markets, often a culprit in big market moves, has been fairly benign,” the analysts wrote.

Aftermath of Terra’s collapse

After USDTerra and its sister coin Luna collapsed last week, several crypto companies and funds have disclosed information about their previous investments in the ecosystem and relevant losses.

Delphi Ventures: Venture capital firm Delphi Ventures said its Master Fund bought “a small amount of Luna” in the first quarter of 2021, which was 0.5% of the fund’s net asset value at the time, according to a Wednesday blog post. The fund has increased its exposure since then. It invested $10 million in a $1 billion Luna sale by Luna Foundation Guard in February, among other commitments, according to the post.

The fund currently sits on a large unrealized loss, the firm said in the post. At Luna’s peak price of $119.5 in April, the coin and other Terra assets made up a total of 13% of the net asset value across Delphi Ventures, according to the post. Companies or protocols related to the Terra ecosystem made up less than 5% of Delphi’s total number of deals, the firm said.

Binance: Binance previously bought 15 million Luna for $3 million, according to Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, chief executive at the crypto exchange. Such a holding now is worth about $2,400, based on Luna’s recent price at $0.00016, according to CoinDesk data. The company has never moved or sold those tokens, Zhao wrote in a tweet Monday.

Galaxy Digital: Once a backer of Luna, billionaire investor Michael Novogratz in January got a wolf-themed tattoo to show his support for the cryptocurrency.

As Luna collapsed, the ink “will be a constant reminder that venture investing requires humility,” Novogratz wrote in an open letter published Wednesday.

The principal investments team of Galaxy Digital, where Novogratz serves as a chief executive, invested in Luna in the fourth quarter of 2020 using balance sheet capital, Novogratz wrote in the letter. The firm’s treasury doesn’t use algorithmic stablecoin, he added.

The billionaire said the collapse of UST and Luna serves as a reminder that in investing, it’s important to “keep a diversified portfolio, take profits along the way, have a risk management framework, and understand that all investments happen in a macro framework.”

“Galaxy did all of these with regards to our investment in LUNA,” according to Novogratz.

The firm expects a $300 million loss in net comprehensive income this quarter as of May 11, bringing the partners’ capital to $2.2 billion, down 12% from March 31, according to a preliminary update released on May 13.

Bit Digital Inc. up 8% to $1.80 after the company said it has recently been informed of two incidents affecting its hosting partners' operations.

The bitcoin mining company said hosting partner Blockfusion USA Inc. advised it that the substation at its Niagara Falls, N.Y., facility was damaged by an explosion and subsequent fire, and power was cut off to 2,515 bitcoin miners and 710 ethereum miners that had been operating at the site immediately prior to the incident.

91,Bitcoin Is Steady Above 29000 Cryptos Are Holding Up as Stocks Sell Off,2022-05-19 11:53:00,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are, in theory, supposed to trade independently of mainstream financial markets. In practice, a tight correlation with stocks—and especially tech stocks—has weighed on digital assets. But not as much as it might.

The price of Bitcoin was higher over the past 24 hours and holding well above $29,500. The relative sturdiness in the largest crypto comes despite a brutal day for U.S. stocks on Wednesday, with a selloff that was continuing into Thursday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.6% and the S&P 500 plunged 4% on Wednesday as the indexes notched their ugliest performances since June 2020. The Nasdaq Composite’s 4.7% decline was only the worst since two weeks ago, underscoring the pressure tech stock—and correlated cryptos—have faced. The pain continued in early Thursday trading, with the Dow quickly shedding more than 400 points.

“​Bitcoin remains a risky asset and vulnerable to further pain if the de-risking continues,” Edward Moya, an analyst at broker Oanda, wrote late Wednesday. Yet cryptos seem relatively sturdy.

While Bitcoin continues to trade around its lowest levels since late 2020, and is changing hands at less than half the record high near $69,000 it reached in November 2021, it hasn’t fallen much further since last week’s cryptocurrency crash.

Bitcoin dropped near $26,000 during the lows of last week, but has stayed around $29,000 since Monday. The S&P 500 has lost 3% over the same period.

Other cryptos were similarly relatively unmoved. Ether dropped 1% to below $2,000. The token underpinning the Ethereum blockchain network was holding above its bottom below $1,800 hit last week, but is still down by one-third from two weeks ago.

Smaller cryptos, or altcoins, showed much of the same. Cardano and Solana both dipped around 1%, though Avalanche plunged 7%.

So-called memecoins, launched more as jokes than as serious efforts to create usable currencies, were slightly lower. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu were both around 2% into the red.

TerraUSD, the stablecoin designed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar that collapsed less than two weeks ago, fueling the crypto selloff, traded at 8 cents. Luna, a related token that through an arbitrage market mechanism is meant to keep Terra on its peg, was changing hands at one-hundredth of a penny. It was at $80 two weeks ago, when it was one of the largest digital assets.

93,The Bear Market in Crypto Is Wiping Out Potential Uses,2022-05-19 08:42:00,"Real-world uses for Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were always a bit flimsy. But the deepening bear market is shaking even those dubious applications, according to J.P. Morgan’s top investment strategist.

“Fortune may not favor the brave after all,” said Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, in a scathing note on crypto published on Tuesday.

The argument that Bitcoin is a store of value keeps disintegrating before our eyes with its eroding price, high correlation to the Nasdaq Composite index, and volatility that remains five times that of the S&P 500, he notes.

Bitcoin was trading around $29,000 on Wednesday, down 58% from its peak near $69,000 last November. Overall, more than $1 trillion of crypto market value has vanished in the last six months as tokens from Ether to Dogecoin have plunged.

The falling value of Bitcoin also repudiates the argument that it’s a hedge against inflation, which is running at an 8% annualized pace, he notes. And Bitcoin isn’t taking off as a means of exchange with daily transactions still below 2018-2020 levels.

The rest of the crypto markets—including decentralized finance or DeFi platforms for trading and lending; blockchain-based gaming; and “stablecoins” that are supposed to act as digital dollars—are also crumbling, in his view.

DeFi platforms have seen a sharp drop in value “locked” on their protocols, falling from around $250 billion in December 2021 to $109 billion now, according to the site DeFillama.com.

Blockchain-based gaming is also suffering. Tokens associated with Axie Infinity—an online game for trading digital pets—have crashed, partly due to a recent hack on Axie’s related blockchain of more than $600 million. Other gaming sites like Sandbox and Decentraland were averaging around 1,000 people a day in late April, Cembalest notes. “I think that’s the number of people still using Lotus 1-2-3,” he said, referring to an ancient spreadsheet program.

More developing countries are imposing rules or cracking down on crypto. And the idea that nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, would ride to the rescue of exchanges like Coinbase Global (ticker: COIN) looks questionable, in his view.

“Coinbase claimed to have three million users on its NFT wait list but since launch has yet to see more than 200 NFT transactions on any given day,” Cembalest writes. Coinbase didn’t reply to a request for comment.

The crypto selloff isn’t confined to tokens. Bitcoin mining stocks have been crushed, as Barron’s recently reported. Many environmentally focused investors are critical of the industry’s heavy carbon footprint–consuming as much annual electricity as countries such as Norway.

Granted, Cembalest has long been a crypto skeptic. In a report from February called the Maltese Falcoin, he came out swinging against Bitcoin, DeFi, stablecoins, and NFTs, though he argued that blockchain technology itself had some good uses.

Crypto proponents argue that while the market is going through a retrenchment, the industry will emerge with less speculative froth and consolidated blockchains that could power a next generation of financial services, gaming and payments.

“Weakness into late May/early June should bring about an appealing time to consider buying into cryptocurrencies in general, and this lines up with cycles which likely bottom out in the near future,” said Fundstrat Global analyst Mark Newton in a note published Wednesday.

It doesn’t help that central banks are raising interest rates and tightening monetary policies, pressuring investments broadly and increasing correlations between cryptos and “risk assets” like tech stocks.

“The internet bubble that burst in 2000 was a reminder that nascent technologies/assets are synonymous with volatility,” said Bloomberg Intelligence commodity strategist Mike McGlone, in note on Monday. “We see 2022’s crypto winter as a necessary cleansing of speculative excesses to solidify the foundation.”

If the washout doesn’t end soon, there won’t be much left to cleanse.

94,Is a graduate degree worth it Here are the pros and cons,2022-05-19 05:01:00,"This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet.

More U.S. workers than ever hold a graduate degree. Years of intensifying job requirements and headlines declaring a master’s “the new bachelor’s degree” nudged a record number of students into grad school.

And yet more well-paying jobs no longer require a college degree at all. In this tight labor market, do college grads need a master’s degree to compete? Maybe not.

“We have all reduced our almost obsession with the master’s degree,” says Johnny C. Taylor Jr., CEO and president of the Society for Human Resource Management.

Anecdotal and statistical evidence shows employers were already pulling back degree requirements even before the pandemic: Data from a job market analysis done by the Burning Glass Institute show a reduction in middle-skills and high-skills requirements — jobs that require more education than a high school diploma — from 2017 to 2019.

If fewer employers are requiring grad degrees to gain entrance to good jobs, prospective students should assess whether advanced degrees are worth taking on debt.

Some fields still require advanced degrees

Advanced degrees are still the key to entering certain professions: Medicine, law and teaching come to mind. In other fields, as long as you can convey you have the skills an employer is looking for, you can get a job without an advanced degree, says Brad Hershbein, senior economist and deputy director of research for the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Advanced degrees could hedge against a recession

Employers are likely reducing education requirements to fill slots, which can be difficult in a tight labor market like this one, experts say. But that doesn’t mean it will last.

“Nobody can quite explain what we’re going through now; I think everyone thinks it’s temporary,” says Gordon Lafer, a professor in the Labor Education & Research Center at the University of Oregon.

Holding an advanced degree could provide a safeguard for the future. If the economic tide turns, Taylor says, the degree becomes a differentiator.

Advanced degrees tend to correlate with lower unemployment rates compared with bachelor’s or associate degrees. But generally, any degree acts as a buffer against unemployment.

During the 2007-09 recession, those with bachelor’s degrees and higher were more likely to keep their jobs, according to 2014 research by the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. The same goes for job retention during the early days of the pandemic, according to June 2020 data from The Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.

Graduate programs don’t always pay off

What consumers need is data that show program-specific outcomes like graduates’ employment rates and average salaries. These are woefully difficult to find. For example, the College Scorecard, a data tool from the U.S. Department of Education, which provides information on outcomes like graduation rates and postgraduate salaries, doesn’t include graduate-level data by major.

The lack of transparency makes it harder for prospective students to make an informed decision. And that could lead some to end up with debt they’re unable to repay.

“Not everyone realizes there’s a risk that it’s a bad financial investment,” says Hershbein.

Graduate loan debt has reached an all-time high, according to data from the federal government and think tanks like the Center for American Progress and Brookings. Unlike undergraduate loans, which have stricter limits on the amount of debt students can take on annually, federal Grad PLUS and private graduate loans allow students to borrow up to the cost of attendance, so it’s easier to rack up debt.

Your earnings after attaining a grad degree will largely depend on your field and employer. Outcomes in some fields are easier to predict than in others, says Hershbein.

“Teachers’ master’s degrees are carefully calibrated; based on union contracts they know what the pay is going to be,” says Hershbein. But outcomes for master’s in areas like public policy or fine arts are more of an unknown, he adds.

Master’s programs are not all equal

Where you get your degree also matters. “If you’re getting an online master’s degree from the University of Phoenix it will pay off less than a master’s degree from the University of Pennsylvania,” Hershbein says.

Taylor says the nature of remote learning during the pandemic erased some of the bias around online programs, but employer preference is still skewed toward degrees from elite colleges.

“I think we have to be honest with ourselves: There’s always an elitism that plays itself into the hiring process,” says Taylor.

For graduate students, attending a highly selective university might help them make professional connections to more easily get a job. And grad programs are “cash cows” for universities, says Hershbein. Universities count on the prestige of their undergraduate degrees to attract graduate students into expensive programs.

Students then rack up exorbitant debt for degrees that might not pay off.

An estimated 40% of master’s degree programs do not pay off at all, according to February 2022 data from the Foundation for Research on Equal Opportunity, a nonprofit think tank.

The uncertainty means prospective students will need to do some legwork to prevent graduate school from harming their finances more than it helps their employment prospects. That means graduate applicants should:

96,MakerDAOs Rune Christensen says Terra was long overdue to collapse calls for rules on stablecoins,2022-05-20 15:10:00,"The collapse of the stablecoin TerraUSD was a bittersweet vindication for Rune Christensen, CEO cofounder of the decentralized crypto project MakerDao, as he had a long track record of arguing that Terra’s model was fundamentally flawed from the beginning.

TerraUSD is an algorithmic stablecoin whose value was pegged at $1. In order to defend that peg, users of TerraUSD were always able to exchange 1 TerraUSD USTUSD, -10.90% for $1 worth of an associated cryptocurrency, LUNA. But there was nothing that guaranteed LUNA’s LUNAUSD, -6.67 value beyond the collective confidence of its holders, a confidence that vanished in short order earlier this month.

Founder Do Kwon last week on Twitter said he was ”heartbroken” following Terra’s crash.

Kwon announced what he said is a plan to “rebirth a new Terra blockchain and LUNA” on Twitter Wednesday.

MakerDao, built on the ethereum ETHUSD, -3.32% blockchain, issues the Dai stablecoin that is backed by a diverse pool of crypto assets. It is known as “overcollateralized” because users have to post more than $1 worth of crypto assets to get back $1 worth of Dai DAIUSD, -0.02% .

MarketWatch caught up with Christensen over video conference Thursday to get his take on the crypto landscape in the wake of the Terra drama and a broader decline in the crypto market. The interview has been edited.

What’s your take on what happened to Terra?

The model that Luna and Terra used, which is nowadays called the algorithmic stablecoin, was invented all the way back in 2014. It was sort of a theoretical idea that everyone could just tell by looking at it that it wasn’t going to work.

During the bull market we just went through, these types of stablecoins started popping up. Terra somehow managed to have more legitimacy and more momentum and actually grow to this massive size.

But it was still obvious that these models didn’t work. It was completely clear. You can’t create money out of thin air. You can’t back something with itself and expect it to remain stable.

It was long overdue to collapse, and it was a tragedy that it was allowed to get so big, in part because it had a lot of major backers who created more legitimacy for it.

Why do you think sophisticated investors were drawn to this model?

Greed allows people to pretend that 1 plus 1 doesn’t equal 2. The promise of being able to print free money is just so strong.

They probably believed there was a chance it could work. There are also some really hardcore public figures that supported Luna and have gained credibility because they actually lost everything. So some of them truly believed that it worked and held on to the end and lost everything.

But there were others…[who] may also have been smart enough to understand that it was basically a ride you only want to take on the way up.

The appeal of Terra was in part because it was decentralized, and there’s a lot of debate as to whether Dai can credibly be called decentralized. What are your thoughts on this discussion?

The Luna community in particular liked to attack Dai, saying it’s not decentralized because it uses USDC USDCUSD, , a centralized stablecoin, as part of its collateral.

The reason why Dai ended up doing that is because the original model that only used ethereum, it used these overcollateralized positions that ensure there’s always more ethereum than there’s Dai in circulation. The problem is you can’t control how much demand there is for people to bet on the price of ethereum.

The only way to scale Dai as demand kept growing was to add something you can easily scale, such as every time somebody wants to have more Dai you can just back it one-to-one with USDC.

From the perspective of single points of failure and decentralization, it’s not ideal to have huge amounts of exposure to just a single, centralized stablecoin. On the other hand it’s better than collapsing and going to zero. So in terms of the choices available, especially at the time when demand started to outstrip the ability to generate supply purely from ether, it was the right choice.

It’s always just a question of how to protect Dai users. Ultimately the holders of the MKR token MKRUSD, -1.23% that confers voting rights, their incentives are aligned with users of Dai because they have to backstop any losses that occur.

It’s obvious that you don’t want to have, whether its centralized or whatever, you don’t want to have all your collateral in a single token. So the community is working very hard to diversity out of USDC into coins like USDP, Paxos USD and Gemini USD.

Is this argument over centralization a productive one?

Centralization exists on a spectrum. You can look at different blockchains and some of them have hundreds of thousands of nodes and others maybe have 100 nodes and some have, like 20. They may all be decentralized, but they’re different levels of decentralization.

You shouldn’t really be thinking only about decentralization. You should be thinking about risk. Centralization isn’t the only type of risk you need be worried about, as evidenced by Terra, right?

It’s just one of many things that you need to consider if your goal is to create something that is stable, useful and relevant.

Where is DeFi going from here?

Now that blockchain has gone through these two major bubbles, one in 2017 and the huge bubble and crash we just had, I think we’re at the end of the honeymoon phase where people had this sense that something amazing is coming just around the corner that’s going to solve all the problems of finance.

The blockchain and DeFi still have the potential to make financial transactions much more efficient and cheap and major financial institutions and banks are working to get real financial instruments on the blockchain.

Societe Generale in France, for instance, is doing experiments where they have created these tokenized assets on MakerDAO, and we’re going to see what kind of benefits this provides.

See also: Prelude to the future of finance? SocGen is raising a loan from a DeFi protocol to refinance tokenized bonds

The collapse of Terra has brought into focus efforts in the U.S. to regulate crypto broadly and stablecoins in particular. What are your thoughts on this debate?

Before the Maker Foundation [which Christensen previously ran] was shut down because MakerDao became sufficiently decentralized to run on its own, we were eager to interact with regulators because we saw regulatory interaction and education as a cornerstone of making stablecoins work.

I’m a big supporter of regulation in general. Regulation exists for a reason and it can be a huge benefit for the space. If it’s done right it can be a huge benefit, it can create confidence and bring more people into the space.

Something like requiring disclosure of what’s backing a stablecoin, it obviously needs to be required by law. It makes no sense to create a product, call it stable and then say I’m not gonna tell you how it’s backed.

The space needs to grow up a little. It makes perfect sense for governments, if somebody is selling a black box and giving all sorts of promises about it, to bring protection to its citizens. It’s a financial transaction like any other and people shouldn’t be allowed to use the excuse that it’s blockchain, so we can just go out and cause harm to people.

97,Why did crypto crash Mark Cuban compares crypto lull to the early internet,2022-05-20 12:51:00,"Mark Cuban, billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, thinks that cryptocurrency is on the same downward trend that tech and internet companies hit in the early 2000s.

Bitcoin hit a 10-month low in May, and sales of non-fungible tokens, aka NFTs, plummeted between January and March 2022.

Cuban addressed the slump in a viral Twitter TWTR, +1.65% thread. “Crypto is going through the lull that the internet went through,” he wrote.

The comparison between cryptocurrency and the early days of the internet has been made by Cuban and others including entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk before. The dot-com bubble burst in 2000 after several internet-centric companies received high levels of investment speculation, only to eventually bottom-out.

Cuban sold his company Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for $5.7 billion, just before the dot-com bust. Broadcast.com has since been discontinued.

See: How a millionaire outbid a billionaire to buy the Golden State Warriors in 2010

The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner is heavily invested and interested in the crypto and NFT space. He claims to own several thousand dollars worth of bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.93% , ethereum ETHUSD, -3.32% and dogecoin DOGEUSD, -3.31% , according to a CNBC report, and also says that 80% of his investments that aren’t on “Shark Tank” are crypto-related.

But what’s next? While NFTs have exploded in popularity over the past few years, with creators like Beeple and NBA Top Shot selling NFTs for millions of dollars, recent NFT sales have plummeted as more creators flooded the marketplace. The average daily transaction volume on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, was down more than 55% from January 2022 to March 2022, according to crypto data tracking platform Dune Analytics.

“I think that early on, you saw lots of new entrants who were enthusiastic about this, but didn’t necessarily have a grasp of the fundamentals, and I think the cooling is a reflection of that,” Jordan Birnholtz, co-founder at NFT marketplace Neon told Distributed Ledger.

Millionaire Vaynerchuk, who invested early in companies like Facebook FB, +0.57% , Twitter, Uber UBER, -0.34% , Snap SNAP, -0.84% and Venmo, told MarketWatch in July 2021 that he, like Cuban, sees NFTs and crypto following similar paths as the early internet companies in the late 1990s.

“I view NFTs exactly the way I viewed the internet in 1999. Internet stocks and their valuations were through the roof, prematurely, and a lot of things collapsed. Meanwhile, eBay EBAY, -1.42% , Google GOOG, -2.37% and Amazon AMZN, -0.41% were all there,” Vaynerchuk said.

Cuban said somethings similar in a now-deleted tweet last January. “Watching the cryptos trade, it’s EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble. EXACTLY,” he wrote. “I think BTC, ETH, a few others will be analogous to those that were built during the dotcom era, survived the bubble bursting and thrived, like AMZN, EBay, and Priceline. Many won’t.”

Cuban’s latest crypto comments come as prices for many cryptocurrencies are plummeting. Prices for bitcoin and ether were hovering around roughly half their November peaks.

99,Bitcoin Is Rising Crypto Traders Are Still Preparing for the Worst,2022-05-20 08:41:00,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were rallying on Friday as digital assets continued a recent outperformance of stocks, though there are signs in the derivatives market that crypto traders are preparing for a move downward.

The price of Bitcoin rose 4% over the past 24 hours to around $30,500. The largest crypto was still trading around the lowest point all year, but comfortably higher than recent levels below $30,000 and well above near $26,000 low reached in last week’s cryptocurrency crash.

“Bitcoin is hovering around the $30,000 level as investors continue to shy away from stocks,” wrote Edward Moya, an analyst at broker Oanda. “A weaker dollar and bear market stock fears are making Bitcoin attractive again.”

Bitcoin and its peers should theoretically trade independently of mainstream financial markets, but have largely shown themselves to be correlated with other risk-sensitive assets—like stocks, and especially tech stocks—over the past year. Some of that correlation has recently faded, with Bitcoin actually outperforming stock indexes like the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq this week.

The leading digital asset has gained almost 10% since Monday, when it changed hands around $29,500. By comparison, based on stock-index futures indicating the U.S. market open on Friday, the S&P 500 has lost 2% this week while the Nasdaq-100 is down 3%.

Stocks are in a rough patch, with the Nasdaq remaining deep in bear market territory—down 28% this year—and the S&P 500 flirting with a bear market.

“Bitcoin looks poised to consolidate [around $30,000], but bulls should be happy to see prices are not mimicking what happens with the stock market,” Moya wrote.

Bitcoin is trading at its lowest levels since July 2021, and remains at less than half its all-time high near $69,000 reached in November. By comparison, the S&P 500 closed on Thursday at its lowest level since March 2021.

The leading digital asset is recovering ever-so slowly from its recent crash, which was largely linked to spillover from a stock market selloff and fueled by the collapse of a systemically-important stablecoin meant to be pegged to the U.S. dollar.

“It seems the fallout from all the stablecoin drama that sent cryptos sharply lower is finally fading,” wrote Moya.

That stablecoin, TerraUSD, continued to trade at a severe discount to the dollar—7 cents. Luna, a related token that through an arbitrage market mechanism is meant to keep Terra on its peg, was changing hands at one-hundredth of a penny. It was at $80 two weeks ago, when it was one of the largest digital assets.

But there remain indications in the derivatives market that crypto traders are readying for—or even betting on—another major downward move in Bitcoin prices.

“The put/call ratio for Bitcoin open interest hit a 12-month high of 0.72 yesterday, indicating bearish sentiment among investors,” wrote a team at crypto market intelligence firm Delphi Digital.

A put/call ratio describes the environment of bets in the options market; puts are bets on prices moving lower, while calls are bets that prices will jump.

“A high put/call ratio indicates that investors are speculating whether bitcoin will continue to sell off, or it could mean investors are hedging their portfolios against a downward move,” the analysts at Delphi said. “Last April, the put/call ratio traded as high as 0.96 before Bitcoin’s price dropped over 50% in May 2021.”

Beyond Bitcoin, the crypto Ether was even more buoyant. The token underpinning the Ethereum blockchain network rose 5% to above $2,050, well above last week’s trough below $1,800, but still down by nearly one-third from two weeks ago.

Smaller cryptos, or altcoins, also gained. Solana rose 4%, Cardano was up 2%, and Avalanche jumped 7%. Memecoins, which were initially intended as internet jokes rather than serious cryptocurrency prospects, were similarly in the green; Dogecoin and Shiba Inu both rallied 2%.

100,How TerraUSD a Digital Token Designed to be Stable Fueled a Crypto Crash,2022-05-19 21:05:00,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies went from bad to worse as selling pressure spread across the tech landscape. But the latest crypto crash was also fueled by stablecoins, a type of token that’s supposed to hold up when everything else tanks.

Stablecoins are designed to maintain a fixed value, typically at $1 per token. But a fast-growing “algorithmic” stablecoin called TerraUSD collapsed this past week to a few pennies on the dollar. That appears to have shaken confidence in the largest stablecoin, Tether. Prices for Tether, or USDT, dipped to 95 cents for a few hours on Thursday, then rebounded to nearly a dollar.

The episode could shake the foundations of crypto. Stablecoins are the bedrock of trading and lending activities, providing liquidity to individual traders, funds, and market makers on both centralized exchanges and decentralized-finance, or DeFi, networks. More than 90% of trading volume in crypto occurs in stablecoins, according to CoinMarketCap. Without stablecoins doing their job—holding their dollar pegs through periods of extreme turmoil—the crypto market may face a loss of confidence, affecting trading activity and prices for tokens ranging from Bitcoin to Dogecoin.

“USDT de-pegging is alarming for all cryptocurrency markets,” says Clara Medalie, research director at Kaiko, a crypto data firm.

This isn’t just a concern for traders and firms in the $1.3 trillion crypto market. Regulators worry that if stablecoins take off as privately issued digital money, they could pose risks to broader markets and monetary policies. A run on a stablecoin could, in theory, lead to heavy selling in assets held as reserves for coin issuers, such as commercial short-term debt. Stablecoins could also substitute for the dollar in international commerce and cross-border payments—making it harder for governments to keep tabs on monetary policies and capital flows.

“The outstanding stock of stablecoins is growing at a very rapid rate, and we really need a consistent federal framework,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, partly in reference to TerraUSD.

Bitcoin’s high volatility and drawbacks as a medium of exchange opened a door for stablecoins to step through. Tether and USD Coin, or USDC, have soared in issuance over the past few years. They’re now worth a combined $130 billion, making them the third- and fourth-largest cryptos, behind Bitcoin and Ether.

“Once you’re in the ecosystem, stablecoins allow you to act as though you have U.S. dollars, when really you own crypto,” says Stéphane Ouellette, CEO of crypto derivatives broker FRNT Financial.

The coins serve numerous purposes: Traders use them to maintain liquidity between transactions and to buy other cryptos; they also play a key role in market-making and are widely used by hedge funds and other proprietary trading firms. Tether, in particular, is the most systemically important; it’s the basis for thousands of “pair trades” on exchanges and DeFi platforms, along with “smart contracts” for lending and borrowing cryptos.

Demand for stablecoins is so high as collateral for trading and borrowing that yields top 8% on many DeFi platforms and centralized sites—and even touched 20% for TerraUSD.

There’s also profit in stablecoins, and it’s attracting banks, payment companies, and fintechs to the space. The bank Silvergate Capital (ticker: SI) aims to revive the stablecoin project originally started by Meta Platforms ’ (FB) Facebook, part of a broad push into crypto banking and brokerage products. Visa (V) is offering settlement services in USDC. The company backing USDC, Circle Internet Financial, is trying to go public via a special-purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC, called Concord Acquisition (CND). Recent investors in Circle include BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity Investments.

The New Crypto Dollars

Like every other cryptocurrency, stablecoin transactions are recorded on blockchains such as Ethereum. While transaction fees may be steep, the coins are well suited for peer-to-peer transfers that bypass traditional banking systems, cutting out intermediaries. That’s one reason they’re often used for remittances or cross-border payments. Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv began welcoming crypto donations in three tokens, including Tether.

There are basically two kinds of stablecoins: asset-backed and algorithmic. Tether and USDC are the two largest asset-backed coins. The companies backing the coins aim to maintain their pegs by holding reserves equivalent to their outstanding issuance. Every time a dollar’s worth of the coins is minted, the companies are supposed to buy a dollar’s worth of reserves; when the coins are redeemed, those reserves may be sold.

Algorithmic coins like TerraUSD are more complex. They aim to maintain their pegs through arbitrage and incentive mechanisms involving other cryptocurrencies. When the price deviates from a dollar, traders can profit through a swap with another token. That is supposed to prevent the price of the stablecoin from deviating much above or below a dollar.

Breaking the Buck

TerraUSD relied on a complex mechanism of minting and burning another token, LUNA, to maintain its dollar peg. A cascade of selling in TerraUSD destabilized its peg, however, and crashed prices for LUNA.

Crypto entrepreneur Do Kwon, based in Korea, had tried to shore up LUNA and TerraUSD with plans to purchase up to $10 billion worth of Bitcoin as collateral through the “Luna Foundation Guard.” Before the crash, the foundation held $3.5 billion in Bitcoin.

The selling pressure arose from withdrawals on a DeFi lending protocol called Anchor that offered yields of 20% on TerraUSD deposits. Roughly $14 billion worth of TerraUSD was deposited in Anchor before the crash. Less than $200 million is left.

“I understand the last 72 hours have been extremely tough on all of you—know that I am resolved to work with every one of you to weather this crisis, and we will build our way out of this,” Kwon said on Twitter on Wednesday. “As we begin to rebuild [Terra], we will adjust its mechanism to be collateralized.”

Still, the Luna Foundation Guard may be running out of money. Its reserves are down to less than $90 million worth of cryptos, and it holds no Bitcoin in its wallet. The crash also took a toll on the Terra blockchain, which briefly shut down on Thursday “to prevent governance attacks,” according to Terra’s Twitter feed. The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, also suspended trading in TerraUSD and LUNA.

Some crypto participants say that while the episode has been painful, it signals that the market is actually functioning. “The market flushed out a weakly designed system, and the speculators that were behind it took a financial hit,” says Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto data firm Messari.

Yet the crash had contagion effects. Luna’s stockpiling of Bitcoin rippled across other cryptos. Traders expecting a meltdown in TerraUSD appear to have sold Bitcoin, contributing to the token’s declines. That, in turn, weakened demand across crypto markets, which lost more than $400 billion in market cap as scores of tokens declined by more than 20%, including Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, and Solana.

USDT hasn’t emerged without a black eye, either, underscoring how contagion from one crypto can spread to others and the broader market.

In theory, USDT shouldn’t deviate far from its peg. Tether Ltd., the company backing the token, says USDT is “backed 100%” by reserves at a one-to-one ratio, and promises that investors can always redeem its tokens for an equivalent amount of real money. If a hedge fund were to send the company one million USDT tokens, for instance, the company would send the fund $1 million, even if the price differs on secondary markets.

The token also relies on arbitrage mechanisms with market makers and trading firms to hold its peg. If the price of USDT falls by even a fraction of a penny on exchanges like Coinbase or FTX, institutional traders can buy USDT at a discount and redeem it with the company, profiting off the spread, or difference, to a buck.

Those mechanics do appear to have worked. The coin was at about 95 cents on the dollar at 3:30 a.m. in New York on Thursday, but by 9 a.m. it was above 99 cents.

Why did the price get so low? Overnight selling pressure before banks opened for business may have contributed—leaving a gap between selling on the secondary market and redemptions with Tether. Moreover, Tether redeems tokens only with “eligible contract participants” such as proprietary trading firms, and it isn’t automatic.

Some market participants say USDT’s loss of dollar peg wasn’t a deal breaker for the token. “The market is functioning, and it’s expected to see minor de-risking of other stablecoins following the Terra de-peg,” says John Kramer, director of trading at market maker GSR.

Ouellette, who deals in Tether through his derivatives firm and a separate hedge fund, describes the situation as a “little spooky,” but adds that it looked like typical “arbitrage friction,” exacerbated by hedge funds that had tried to attack USDT and profit off a decline.

Still, Tether hasn’t inspired confidence with its limited disclosures and reserve practices. Based in the British Virgin Islands, Tether issues a periodic “assurance opinion” on its reserves from a Cayman Islands auditor. The last one was from December. In it, Tether said that 84% of its reserves were in cash and equivalents, Treasuries, short-term deposits, and commercial paper. The rest consisted of $4.1 billion in “secured loans”; $3.6 billion in “corporate bonds, funds, and precious metals”; and $5 billion in “other investments,” including “digital tokens.”

The company said Thursday that it had reduced its holdings of commercial paper by 50% over the past six months, and now holds the majority of its assets in Treasuries.

Still, Tether has run into legal troubles, settling charges last year with New York state and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over its reserves and disclosure practices.

“Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, Tether holds a strong, conservative, and liquid portfolio,” a Tether spokesperson tells Barron’s. Tether has maintained its stability “through multiple black-swan events” and never refused a redemption, the spokesperson adds. Tether added in a statement that “it is business as usual” and was processing more than $2 billion in redemption requests “without issue.”

Crypto Rules Are Coming

The volatility in stablecoins may only build momentum to bring some rules and supervision to the space.

The Biden administration, for one, wants coin issuers under federal supervision, potentially even carrying FDIC deposit insurance. Biden called on Congress to pass supervisory rules for stablecoins in a recent executive order on crypto.

Congress is also working on a variety of rules for stablecoins; a draft bill in the Senate would establish a process for banks and credit unions to issue stablecoins, among other measures. Sen. Patrick Toomey (R., Pa.) recently introduced a framework for regulating “payment stablecoins,” though it wouldn’t address algorithmic coins, which are looking far less stable than asset-backed coins.

U.S. regulators and lawmakers have expressed several concerns. One is about the liquidity and quality of issuers’ reserve assets—whether they can readily meet redemption requests in a panic scenario. Another growing concern is contagion to broader financial markets if there’s a run on a major stablecoin like USDT.

Many trading firms hold large amounts of USDT for market-making and liquidity. Those institutions need to be confident that USDT is fully backed and that they’ll be fully repaid in dollars when redeeming large amounts. “I don’t know too many institutional market participants that are concerned about the reserves in Tether,” says Selkis.

Yet if those trading firms were to lose faith in Tether, they may quickly try to sell their holdings on secondary markets. Without a government backstop like the Fed or Treasury Department, USDT would be at the mercy of the market, potentially causing shockwaves to other cryptos and trading at brokerages from Coinbase Global (COIN) to PayPal Holdings (PYPL).

“If you’re a regulator, I think what they’re worried about is not that the crypto community goes poof; it’s that the losses at Coinbase then feed to PayPal and then feed to a bank,” says Bryan Routledge, a professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University.

Stability Is All Relative

If anyone might emerge stronger from this, it’s Circle, the company backing USDC. Based in the U.S., Circle says its reserves now consist of cash and Treasuries, fully backing every token.

CEO Jeremy Allaire said on Thursday that the company had issued $1 billion in USDC over the prior 24 hours, which he attributed to a “flight to quality” as investors sought issuers that were fully backed and transparent. “There are others that have chosen not to participate in a regulatory framework,” he said. “Naturally, there are more questions about that.”

Circle, of course, is trying to be a model citizen as it aims to go public. Its revenue model centers partly on generating income from reserve assets and lending activities. Rising interest rates should boost the yield on its reserves. The firm is awaiting regulatory approval for its SPAC merger from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allaire said he expects the merger to be completed later this year.

Circle probably won’t be profitable for at least another year, though. It’s projecting adjusted operating profits of $677 million in 2023, assuming that USDC in circulation reaches $220 billion, with 5,000 institutional accounts and $6.4 billion in lending volume. More shocks to the crypto ecosystem would probably derail those plans, and Circle’s profits.

102,Bitcoin Is Steady Above 29000 Cryptos Are Holding Up as Stocks Sell Off,2022-05-19 11:53:00,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are, in theory, supposed to trade independently of mainstream financial markets. In practice, a tight correlation with stocks—and especially tech stocks—has weighed on digital assets. But not as much as it might.

The price of Bitcoin was higher over the past 24 hours and holding well above $29,500. The relative sturdiness in the largest crypto comes despite a brutal day for U.S. stocks on Wednesday, with a selloff that was continuing into Thursday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 3.6% and the S&P 500 plunged 4% on Wednesday as the indexes notched their ugliest performances since June 2020. The Nasdaq Composite’s 4.7% decline was only the worst since two weeks ago, underscoring the pressure tech stock—and correlated cryptos—have faced. The pain continued in early Thursday trading, with the Dow quickly shedding more than 400 points.

“​Bitcoin remains a risky asset and vulnerable to further pain if the de-risking continues,” Edward Moya, an analyst at broker Oanda, wrote late Wednesday. Yet cryptos seem relatively sturdy.

While Bitcoin continues to trade around its lowest levels since late 2020, and is changing hands at less than half the record high near $69,000 it reached in November 2021, it hasn’t fallen much further since last week’s cryptocurrency crash.

Bitcoin dropped near $26,000 during the lows of last week, but has stayed around $29,000 since Monday. The S&P 500 has lost 3% over the same period.

Other cryptos were similarly relatively unmoved. Ether dropped 1% to below $2,000. The token underpinning the Ethereum blockchain network was holding above its bottom below $1,800 hit last week, but is still down by one-third from two weeks ago.

Smaller cryptos, or altcoins, showed much of the same. Cardano and Solana both dipped around 1%, though Avalanche plunged 7%.

So-called memecoins, launched more as jokes than as serious efforts to create usable currencies, were slightly lower. Dogecoin and Shiba Inu were both around 2% into the red.

TerraUSD, the stablecoin designed to be pegged to the U.S. dollar that collapsed less than two weeks ago, fueling the crypto selloff, traded at 8 cents. Luna, a related token that through an arbitrage market mechanism is meant to keep Terra on its peg, was changing hands at one-hundredth of a penny. It was at $80 two weeks ago, when it was one of the largest digital assets.

104,Renault unveils hydrogenpowered prototype SUV in race to cleaner driving,2022-05-19 08:52:59,"
PARIS, May 19 (Reuters) - Renault (RENA.PA) unveiled on Thursday a prototype hydrogen fuel cell-powered sports utility vehicle (SUV), as the French carmaker scrambles to catch up with rivals in the race to cleaner driving.

Renault said the car, dubbed the 'Scenic Vision', would not be commercially available before 2030-2032. A fully electric version will hit the market in 2024.

A fuel cell vehicle has an electric motor just like an electric vehicle, but the motor is powered by electricity produced through hydrogen, enhancing the battery's range.


A 16kW fuel cell will extend the car's range to 800km without recharging, and the battery will be twice as light, resulting in a 75% reduction in carbon footprint compared to a conventional electric model, Renault said.

The Scenic Vision comes as Renault pushes ahead with plans to split its electric vehicle and combustion engine businesses.

A pioneer in electric cars with Japan's Nissan (7201.T) and Mitsubishi (7211.T) at the start of the previous decade, Renault has been eclipsed by pure player Tesla (TSLA.O) and the ambitions of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE).

Asian carmakers Toyota (7203.T) and Hyundai (005380.KS) already have hydrogen fuel cells cars on the market, while BMW is planning to launch the hydrogen iX5 this year as a small batch series.

108,Musk denies he sexually harassed flight attendant Tesla shares sink,2022-05-20 19:30:11,"
Shares of the electric carmaker skidded more than 10% on Friday amid concerns that the alleged sexual misconduct and Musk's political comments could threaten to damage Tesla's brand and sales.

Business Insider reported on Thursday that Musk's private company SpaceX paid $250,000 in 2018 to settle a sexual harassment claim from an unnamed private jet flight attendant who accused Musk of exposing himself to her.


The article quoted an anonymous person who said she was a friend of the flight attendant. The friend had provided a statement as part of the private settlement process, according to the article.

""I have a challenge to this liar who claims their friend saw me 'exposed' – describe just one thing, anything at all (scars, tattoos, …) that isn’t known by the public. She won’t be able to do so, because it never happened,"" Musk wrote on Twitter late on Thursday.

Reuters was not able to verify the Business Insider account.

Musk and SpaceX did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the Business Insider story or on tweets by the billionaire.

In a statement to Reuters on Friday, Business Insider said: ""We stand by our story which is based on documents and interviews and which speaks for itself.""

The sexual misconduct claims ""have the potential from a PR perspective to turn people off,"" said Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid.

Friday's share drop knocked about $66 billion off Tesla's market value and put the stock at its lowest since last August.

The shares have fallen sharply since early April as Musk's plan to buy Twitter sparked concerns about distraction and as China's COVID lockdown measures hurt production at Tesla.

Ross Gerber, CEO of Tesla investor Gerber Kawasaki Wealth Management, said he is concerned that Tesla relies so heavily on a single person, Musk, but he believes his liberal clients will continue buying Musk's cars, even if they don't like what he says, since Tesla's mission is clear.

POLITICAL ATTACKS?

Business Insider quoted the friend of the flight attendant as saying that in addition to allegedly exposing himself, Musk rubbed the flight attendant's thigh and offered to buy her a horse if she would ""do more"" during an in-flight massage.

The flight attendant came to believe that her refusal to accept Musk's proposal had hurt her opportunities to work at SpaceX and prompted her to hire a lawyer in 2018, according to Business Insider.

In 2018, the rocket company paid $250,000 in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims and included a nondisclosure agreement that prevented the flight attendant from speaking about it, Business Insider said. The news site did not name the friend or the flight attendant.

Musk, who is in the midst of a contentious effort to buy Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), said on Wednesday that he would vote Republican instead of Democrat, predicting a ""dirty tricks campaign against me"" would follow.

On Thursday evening, Musk first tweeted: ""The attacks against me should be viewed through a political lens – this is their standard (despicable) playbook – but nothing will deter me from fighting for a good future and your right to free speech.""

In the initial tweet, he did not specifically mention the allegations in the Business Insider article.

He also tweeted that the article was meant to interfere with the Twitter acquisition.

109,Analysis Musks ESG attack spotlights 35 trillion industry confusion,2022-05-20 19:00:16,"
LONDON/BOSTON, May 20 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's rejection of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) scores as a ""scam"" highlights how Wall Street's hottest investment trend that encompasses some $35 trillion in assets means different things to different people.

The chief executive of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) lashed out on Wednesday against S&P Global Inc (SPGI.N) after the electric car maker was dropped from its flagship ESG index while it added some companies whose activities are harmful to the environment, such as oil and gas producers.

Musk took to Twitter to express his frustration with the move ""despite Tesla doing more for the environment than any company ever!"" He added that ESG ""has been weaponized by phoney social justice warriors.""


S&P Dow Jones Indices senior director Margaret Dorn told Reuters that Tesla had been excluded from the index because its score declined slightly just as the scores of other automakers had improved. Tesla was not excluded because S&P executives decided to kick the company out of the index over a particular issue, she added. read more

While Tesla's cars contribute to lower carbon emissions, its ESG score had ""fallen behind"" in other aspects, such as poor working conditions at its U.S. Fremont factory, claims of racial discrimination and its handling of a U.S. government probe into multiple deaths and injuries linked to its autopilot technology.

Sustainable investing - taking into account ESG factors in portfolio selection - has exploded in recent years, reaching $35.3 trillion by the start of 2020, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance.

Half a dozen investment managers interviewed by Reuters said Musk's spat with S&P illustrates how confusion still reigns over how many investors and executives view the industry.

Some, like Musk, believe the ratings should reward companies that do the most for the planet and society. Others, including firms like S&P that produce the scores, say they are meant to show how much risk a company's stock faces from ESG factors.

This explains why some companies that are major contributors to climate change, such as Exxon Corp (XOM.N), are allowed to stay in an ESG index if they can show they are taking actions to reduce that risk.

""Ultimately ESG is a way of identifying and trying to quantify risk. So it's basically risk mitigation,"" said Chi Chan, portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. ""Effectively Musk is conflating ESG with sustainability.""

Mark Tinker, chief investment officer at Toscafund Hong Kong, said Musk ""rightly pointed out"" that societal and corporate governance considerations are being used ""for political driven cancelling"" and that a company's contribution to the environment can also ""mean what you want it to.""

""The whole thing is very subjective,"" Tinker said.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of the company or Musk.

S&P published the change in its ESG index on April 22. But it was not until May 18, a day after Horn wrote a blog post that explained why Tesla was excluded from the index, that Twitter users started disseminating it, catching Musk's attention.

Only a tiny fraction of the ESG's industry's assets under management - $11.7 billion as of the end of 2020 - are tied to S&P Indexes. S&P's influential ESG index rival MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) has so far kept Tesla in its bluechip ESG index.

It was not immediately clear if the exclusion from the S&P ESG index had any impact on Tesla's shares this week. The stock had already been sliding almost every day since early April, losing close to 40% of its value, amid concerns that China's COVID-19-related lockdowns will disrupt Tesla's car production and a potential economic slowdown and raging inflation will dampen demand for its vehicles. read more

Uncertainty over whether Musk will complete his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) has also weighed on Tesla's stock.

SCORE BREAKDOWN

S&P declined to provide a breakdown of its ESG score of Tesla, which is compiled based on scores of the company's various operations and practices.

MSCI also declined to provide a breakdown, but a May 3 copy of its Tesla rating sent to investors and reviewed by Reuters shows how its perceived poor performance on social issues took some of the shine out of the company's strong green credentials.

Tesla scored 9.1 out of 10 on environmental grounds, against an industry average of 6.5. This made up 30% of its total ESG score. On social issues, however, it ranked 1.4 compared with an average of 3.5, while on governance it scored 5.1 against an average of 3.2.

Andrew Poreda, senior vice president for Sage Advisory Services, an Austin-based investment firm, said as a Tesla investor he understood why the company's ESG scores were lower than they might have been based solely on the company's contribution in the fight against climate change.

""You can't live in a vacuum of just environmental or just social issues, they are all intertwined,"" Poreda said.

110,Twitter to tackle Ukraine conflict misinformation with warning labels,2022-05-20 04:02:20,"
May 19 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) will begin placing warning notices in front of some misleading content regarding the conflict in Ukraine and limit the spread of claims debunked by humanitarian groups or other credible sources, the social media company said on Thursday.

The step-up against misinformation around Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation,"" is part of a new policy that outlines how Twitter will approach misinformation during crises.

Social media platforms have faced increasing scrutiny over how they determine and handle misinformation. Twitter has agreed to sell itself to Tesla (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk, who has said he believes the site should be a platform of free speech.


The new warning notices will alert users that a tweet has violated Twitter's rules, but still allow people to view and comment. The platform will not amplify or recommend such tweets and retweeting will also be disabled.

The approach could be ""a more effective way to intervene to prevent harm, while still preserving and protecting speech on Twitter,"" said Yoel Roth, head of safety and integrity at Twitter, during a call with reporters.

The company will prioritize adding labels to misleading tweets from high-profile accounts such as verified users or official government profiles. It will also prioritize content that could cause harm to people on the ground.

Twitter said it defines crises as situations where there is a widespread threat to life, physical safety, health or basic subsistence. It said the policy would initially focus on international armed conflicts but is also intended for events like mass shootings or natural disasters.

""While the timeline for this work began before the war in Ukraine broke out, the need for this policy came into even clearer focus as the conflict in Ukraine unfolded,"" said Roth.

111,Elon Musk to meet with Brazils Bolsonaro says report,2022-05-20 01:39:31,"
SAO PAULO, May 19 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and business magnate Elon Musk are scheduled to meet in Sao Paulo on Friday, Brazilian daily O Globo reported late Thursday.

The two will discuss a potential partnership on rural connectivity and deforestation monitoring, according to O Globo.

The meeting follows a meeting of the SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA.O) chief executive with Brazilian Communications Minister Fabio Faria in November in Austin, Texas. The two spoke about using SpaceX technology to bring internet to rural schools and cut back on illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.


According to the O Globo report, the Friday meeting will happen in an upscale hotel near the city of Sorocaba in Sao Paulo state and will be attended by several business executives, including Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) Chief Executive Pietro Labriola and the chairman of Brazilian lender Banco BTG Pactual (BPAC3.SA), Andre Esteves.

Musk will meet Brazil's far-right president just days after he said on Twitter he could no longer support Democrats ""and will vote Republican.""

Bolsonaro, who celebrated Twitter's announcement of its acceptance of Musk's initial bid for the company, has been trying for years to lure Tesla to Brazil.

In 2020, his son, congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, said he had met with the former charge d'affaires at the U.S. embassy in Brasilia, William Popp, to discuss a plan to attract the automaker to build a factory in the country. Soon after, Bolsonaro stated a desire to visit a Tesla plant on a visit to the U.S.

112,Musk says Tesla is on my mind 247 amid concerns about Twitter distraction,2022-05-20 01:12:40,"
SAN FRANCISCO, May 19 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk said on Thursday that ""Tesla is on my mind 24/7,"" trying to soothe investor worries about him being distracted by a Twitter (TWTR.N) deal that has depressed stocks at the electric car company.

Posting a picture showing a woman (Tesla) who is upset by her boyfriend (Elon) checking out another woman (Twitter), he said, ""So may seem like below, but not true.""

""To be clear, I’m spending <5% (but actually) of my time on the Twitter acquisition. It ain’t rocket science!"" he tweeted.


""Yesterday was Giga Texas, today is Starbase. Tesla is on my mind 24/7.""

Tesla this year opened its new car factory in Texas, and Musk's rocket company SpaceX has a launch site known as Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas.

Tesla shares have lost one third of their value since the billionaire disclosed his stake in Twitter in early April and sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla stocks in a move seen to help finance his $44-billion Twitter deal.

Further hurting stocks are China lockdown measures that dampened Tesla's production and an exclusion of Tesla from a widely-followed S&P sustainability index. read more

Tesla bull Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, on Thursday cut the target share price of Tesla due to the China production disruption and warned of ""distraction risks"" from Musk's Twitter deal.

Leo KoGuan, a major individual investor in Tesla, on Thursday called on the electric carmaker to buy back shares.

""Tesla must announce immediately and buy back $5 billion of Tesla shares from its free cash flow this year and $10 billion from its free cash flow next year, without effecting its existing $18 billion cash reserves with ZERO debt,"" KoGuan said in a Twitter message to Tesla's head of investor relations, Martin Viecha.

Viecha was not immediately available for comment.

Last year, KoGuan, the third largest individual shareholder of Tesla, said he was investing billions in Tesla because he believes in Musk's ""great mission that I share."" He said in March that he was buying more Tesla shares, not selling during the stocks' dip.

May 19 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended lower after a volatile session on Thursday, with Cisco Systems slumping after giving a dismal outlook, while investors fretted about inflation and rising interest rates.

Shares of Cisco (CSCO.O) slumped 13.7% after the networking gear maker lowered its 2022 revenue growth outlook, taking a hit from its Russia exit and component shortages related to COVID-19 lockdowns in China. read more

Apple (AAPL.O) and chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO.O) declined 2.5% and 4.3%, respectively, and weighed on the S&P 500.


""The reality is that inflation is running hot and interest rates are rising,"" said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management in Minneapolis, Minnesota. ""Until you get that inflation rate to start slowing, we're going to have increased volatility, and in our view that continues through throughout most of the summer months.""

Twitter (TWTR.N) climbed 1.2% after Bloomberg reported that company executives told staff that Elon Musk's $44-billion deal was proceeding as expected and they would not renegotiate the price. read more

The S&P consumer staples index (.SPLRCS) fell 2% to its lowest level since December as retail firms face the brunt of rising prices hurting the purchasing power of U.S. consumers.

Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) became the latest retailer to flag a hit from four-decades high inflation as the department store chain cut its full-year profit forecast. read more

Its shares, however, rebounded over 4% after slumping 11% in the previous session due to dismal results from Target Corp (TGT.N).

The S&P 500 is down about 18% from its record close on Jan. 3 as investors adjust to strong inflation, geopolitical uncertainty stemming from the war in Ukraine and tightening financial conditions with the U.S. Federal Reserve raising rates.

A close of 20% or more below its January record high would confirm the S&P 500 has been in a bear market since hitting that peak, according to a widely used definition.

114,EXCLUSIVE TikTok plans big push into gaming conducting tests in Vietnam sources,2022-05-19 22:59:53,"
HONG KONG/HANOI, May 19 (Reuters) - TikTok has been conducting tests so users can play games on its video-sharing app in Vietnam, part of plans for a major push into gaming, four people familiar with the matter said.

Featuring games on its platform would boost advertising revenue as well as the amount of time users spend on the app - one of the world's most popular with more than 1 billion monthly active users.

Boasting a tech-savvy population with 70% of its citizens under the age of 35, Vietnam is an attractive market for social media platforms such as TikTok, Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Facebook and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube and Google.


TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, also plans to roll out gaming more widely in Southeast Asia, the people said. That move could come as early as the third quarter, said two of them.

The sources declined to be identified as the information has yet to be publicly disclosed.

A TikTok representative said the company has tested bringing HTML5 games, a common form of minigame, to its app through tie-ups with third-party game developers and studios such as Zynga Inc (ZNGA.O). But it declined to comment on its plans for Vietnam or its broader gaming ambitions.

""We're always looking at ways to enrich our platform and regularly test new features and integrations that bring value to our community,"" the representative said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment.

Reuters was not able to learn TikTok's plans for rolling out gaming features in other markets. Although TikTok users can watch games being streamed, in most regions they are not able to play games within the TikTok app.

In the United States, only a few games appear to have been launched including Zynga's ""Disco Loco 3D"", a music and dance challenge game and ""Garden of Good"", where players grow vegetables to trigger donations by TikTok to the non-profit Feeding America.

According to two sources, TikTok plans to draw primarily on ByteDance's suite of games.

While the company will start with minigames, which tend to have simple game play mechanisms and a short playing time, its gaming ambitions extend beyond that, said one of the people who had direct knowledge of the matter.

TikTok will require a licence to feature games on its platform in Vietnam where authorities restrict games depicting gambling, violence, and sexual content. The process is expected to go smoothly as the games planned are not controversial, the person said.

Vietnam's foreign and communications ministries did not respond to requests for comment.

Users of ByteDance's Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, have been able to play games on the platform since 2019.

TikTok's games are likely to carry advertisements from the start, with revenue split between ByteDance and game developers, a separate source said.

TikTok's foray into games mirrors similar efforts made by major tech firms seeking to retain users. Facebook launched Instant Games in 2016 and streaming firm Netflix (NFLX.O) also recently added games to its platform.

It also marks the latest ByteDance effort to establish itself as a major contender in gaming. It acquired Shanghai-based gaming studio Moonton Technology last year, putting it in direct competition with Tencent (0700.HK), China's biggest gaming firm.

Even without gaming, TikTok has seen advertising revenue surge. Its advertising revenue is likely to triple this year to more than $11 billion, exceeding the combined sales of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Snap Inc (SNAP.N), according to research firm Insider Intelligence. read more

115,Meet the Wikipedia editor who published the Buffalo shooting entry minutes after it started,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"(CNN Business) After Jason Moore, from Portland, Oregon, saw headlines from national news sources on Google News about the Buffalo shooting at a local supermarket on Saturday afternoon, he did a quick search for the incident on Wikipedia. When no results appeared, he drafted a single sentence: ""On May 14, 2022, 10 people were killed in a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York."" He hit save and published the entry on Wikipedia in less than a minute.

That article, which as of Friday has been viewed more than 900,000 times, has since undergone 1,071 edits by 223 editors who've voluntarily updated the page on the internet's free and largest crowdsourced encyclopedia. Moore, who works as a strategist for a digital creative agency, has made nearly 500,000 edits to Wikipedia articles over the past 15 years. He is also ranked as one of the 50 most active English-language Wikipedia users of all time, based on the number of edits. (Wikipedia editors do not get paid.)

""It's a hobby,"" Moore told CNN Business. ""I sometimes spend a lot of time diving in and fleshing out an article, but other times I'm writing one or two sentences to get the ball rolling and watching other editors improve upon my work. I get a lot of satisfaction out of planting the seed and watching it evolve over time.""

He's credited with creating 50,000 entries, including some prominent breaking news pages such as one for the 2021 United States Capitol attack . He was also a major editor to the George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protest pages. ""I had a lot more time when we were in lockdown that I could dedicate to quality Wikipedia work,"" he said.

In the middle of breaking news, when people are searching for information, some platforms can present more questions than answers. Although Wikipedia is not staffed with professional journalists, it is viewed as an authoritative source by much of the public, for better or for worse. Its entries are also used for fact-checking purposes by some of the biggest social platforms, adding to the stakes and reach of the work from Moore and others.

The day after the Buffalo shooting, Moore created the page for the shooting at Geneva Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods, California, where one person was killed, and five others were injured (four critically). But he's also created pages for earthquakes, wildfires, terrorism attacks and other breaking news moments.

""Editing Wikipedia can absolutely take an emotional toll on me, especially when working on difficult topics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, mass shootings, terrorist attacks, and other disasters,"" he said. ""I've learned how to minimize this by stepping away if needed and revisiting tasks at a later time.""

Jason Moore is credited with creating more than 50,000 Wikipedia pages

Moore is part of a subculture of Wikipedia users who spend hours each day contributing to the platform, helping to fulfill the organization's mission to ""create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language."" He calls his work as a volunteer editor ""rewarding.""

""I like the instant gratification of making the internet better,"" he said. ""I want to direct people to something that is going to provide them with much more reliable information at a time when it's very difficult for people to understand what sources they can trust.""

While anyone can contribute to a Wikipedia story, editors who are fast, reliable and resourceful have developed strong reputations in the ""close knit"" Wikipedia editor community. Steven Pruitt, for example, is perhaps the most well known Wikipedia editor -- he has made more than 4.7 million edits, more than any other user on the site. In 2017, Time Magazine named him one of the top 25 most influential people on the internet.

Some of these expert users attend Wikipedia editor conferences and meetups all over the world. ""We're kind of like ants,"" Moore said. ""You kind of find how you fit in and how you can help.""

Cutting out the noise

Although Wikipedia topics vary, it's evolved over the years as a destination for up-to-date information on breaking news. Wikipedia articles for current events often bring in hundreds of thousands of views, and other major tech companies, such as Facebook and YouTube, often use Wikipedia for fact-checking content on their own platforms. (Wikipedia entries summarize, present, and cite reliable sources, along with links to helpful resources that may otherwise be considered tangential in a traditional news article.)

Lane Rasberry, who is employed at the School of Data Science at the University of Virginia and was a volunteer Wikipedia editor for 10 years, said there's also an allure and a culture around people involved in high-profile breaking news situations on Wikipedia.

""It is considered cool if you're the first person who creates an article, especially if you do it well with high-quality contributions,"" said Rasberry. ""Just like when a celebrity dies, there's a rush to go to Wikipedia and change their [date of] death. People like to be first ... and also make an impact"" in getting reliable and accurate information out quickly.

To help patrol incoming edits and predict misconduct or errors, Wikipedia -- like Twitter -- uses artificial intelligence bots that can escalate suspicious content to human reviewers who monitor content. However, the volunteer editors of the Wikipedia community make decisions on what to remove or edit. The platform also uses admins, known as ""trusted users,"" who can apply or are nominated for the role, to help monitor content.

Rasberry, who also wrote the Wikipedia page on the platform's fact checking processes , said Wikipedia does not employ paid staff to monitor anything unless it involves ""strange and unusual serious crimes like terrorism or real world violence, such as using Wikipedia to make threats, plan to commit suicide, or when Wikipedia itself is part of a crime.

Rasberry said flaws range from a geographical bias , which is related to challenges with communicating across languages; access to internet in lower and middle income countries; and barriers to freedom of journalism around the world.

In addition, the organization behind Wikipedia has previously said it believes only a small percentage of Wikipedia editors are women. Other issues involve "" deletionism "" -- when an article is deleted because there's not enough journalism to support the topic -- and ideological bias , where Wikipedia may match the ideological bias of the news ecosystem.

Another issue is vandalism, or people who make purposefully erroneous edits on Wikipedia pages. But Moore said he doesn't worry about his own pages falling victim to vandalism because he believes Wikipedia's guidelines and policies are working in his favor.

""I've got many other editors that I'm working with who will back me, so when we encounter vandalism or trolls or misinformation or disinformation, editors are very quick to revert inappropriate edits or remove inappropriate content or poorly sourced content,"" Moore said.

While ""edit wars"" can happen on pages, Rasberry said this tends to occur more often over social issues rather than news. ""People have always assumed edit wars [play out on] Wikipedia and it does not happen nearly as much as outsiders expect,"" he said. ""Wikipedia has both technological and social structures in place, which most people find agreeable and appropriate, and which permit many people to edit at once.""

Wikipedia also publicly displays who edits each version of an article via its history page , along with a ""talk"" page for each post that allows editors to openly discuss edits.

""Administrators are very quick to block those who do not obey the rules, so if you're coming to Wikipedia with mal-intent, you're wasting your time because we will stop you from contributing to the site,"" Moore said.

Challenges exist with getting users full access to news on Wikipedia, too. Rasberry said that due to news or magazine subscription costs, some Wikipedia editors may not be able to access and cite those sources in their updates. ""Access to media and interpreting media is a major bottleneck,"" said Rasberry, saying ""news agencies [should] see Wikipedia as more of a collaborator than rival news source.""

Wikipedia volunteers have created lots of guidance on reliable news sources. A dedicated Wikipedia page on the topic notes that articles should be ""based on reliable, published sources, making sure that all majority and significant minority views that have appeared in those sources are covered.""

""If no reliable sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it,"" the page said.

Although Moore is known among friends, colleagues and those in the Wikipedia editor community as being a Wikipedia influencer, the weight of that title is far less than the fame one can acquire on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.

New York CNN Business —

Elon Musk denied allegations that he sexually harassed a SpaceX flight attendant in 2016 in a series of late-night tweets.

“I have a challenge to this liar who claims their friend saw me ‘exposed’ – describe just one thing, anything at all (scars, tattoos, …) that isn’t known by the public. She won’t be able to do so, because it never happened,” the Tesla and SpaceX CEO tweeted early Friday morning.

The tweet comes after Business Insider reported that SpaceX paid a $250,000 settlement in 2018 after a SpaceX flight attendant alleged sexual misconduct against the billionaire.

Nicholas Carlson, the editor-in-chief of Insider, the parent publication of Business Insider, responded to Musk’s denial on Twitter.

“We stand by our story, which is based on documents and interviews and speaks for itself,” a tweeted statement reads.

Citing documents and interviews it conducted, Business Insider reported that “the attendant worked as a member of the cabin crew on a contract basis for SpaceX’s corporate jet fleet. She accused Musk of exposing his erect penis to her, rubbing her leg without consent, and offering to buy her a horse in exchange for an erotic massage.”

In his request to Insider for more time to respond to the allegations, Musk said there was “a lot more to this story.”

“If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light,” he told Business Insider. The outlet also said Musk characterized the story as a “politically motivated hit piece.”

In separate tweets, Musk later denied that he ever responded to Business Insider while they were reporting the story and attempted to link the article to his Thursday announcement that he “will vote Republican” and his attempt to acquire Twitter — a deal he recently put “on hold.”

“Did you actually respond to the reporters from BI?” one user tweeted at Musk.

“No,” Musk responded, “it was clear that their only goal was a hit price (sic) to interfere with the Twitter acquisition. The story was written before they even talked to me.”

“They began brewing attacks of all kinds as soon as the Twitter acquisition was announced,” Musk added in a separate tweet. “In my 30 year career, including the entire MeToo era, there’s nothing to report, but, as soon as I say I intend to restore free speech to Twitter & vote Republican, suddenly there is.”

The publication reached out to Musk about the story in question before he tweeted about voting Republican, according to John Cook, the investigations editor at Insider.

“For those interested, we reached out to the principals for comment regarding this story at ~9 a.m. eastern yesterday (Wednesday May 18),” Cook said on Twitter.

Musk’s tweet declaring his voting intentions was posted at 2:44 pm ET on Wednesday, though he also made comments to that effect in a virtual interview posted to YouTube on May 16.

The Business Insider article states that it “extended the deadline and reiterated the offer to Musk to comment on the claims. He did not respond.”

118,Tesla cut from SP 500 ESG Index and Elon Musk tweets his fury,2022-05-19 16:13:27,"
In it changes, effective May 2, the sustainability index also added soon-to-be-Musk-controlled Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) while dropping Delta Air Lines and Chevron Corp, according to an announcement.

The back-and-forth over the index changes reflects a wider debate about the metrics used to judge corporate performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, a growing area of investing.


Tesla has become the most valuable auto industry company by pioneering EVs and expanding into battery storage for electric grids and solar-power systems.

Factors contributing to its departure from the index included Tesla's lack of published details related to its low carbon strategy or business conduct codes, said Margaret Dorn, S&P Dow Jones Indices' head of ESG indices for North America, in an interview.

Even though Tesla's products help cut planet-warming emissions, Dorn said, its other issues and lack of disclosures relative to industry peers should raise concerns for investors looking to judge the company across environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.

""You can't just take a company's mission statement at face value, you have to look at their practices across all those key dimensions,"" she said.

Tesla representatives did not immediately respond to questions. The company has previously called ESG methodologies ""fundamentally flawed.""

Musk tweeted that ""Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list! ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.""

Asked about the tweet, a representative for the index provider said Musk may have been referring to a list on a company blog post of the largest 10 constituents by market cap of the S&P 500 ESG Index after the removal of Tesla and others. The list is ""not a ranking of best companies by ESG score,"" the representative said.

Exxon now accounts for 1.443% of the weight of the index. Apple Inc was the largest at 9.657%.

GROWING CONCERNS

Investors concerned about issues like diversity and climate change have poured billions of dollars into funds using ESG criteria to pick stocks, prompting debate about how effectively the funds promote change or whether they push companies too much on issues that should be settled by government policy.

S&P Dow Jones Indices is majority-owned by S&P Global Inc. (SPGI.N) Musk and others have complained the firm and its rivals conflate too many issues by bundling ESG concerns into one total score.

For instance a fund based on the S&P 500 ESG Index, the SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF, received the low rating ""D"" by climate activist research group As You Sow, which noted despite its title and sustainability mandate, fossil fuel stocks make up 6.5% of fund assets.

In the company blog post reviewing changes from April 22, S&P's Dorn said the index aims to keep industries weighted the same as they are in the regular S&P 500 index ""while enhancing the overall sustainability profile of the index."" In practice that means it can keep oil companies while leaving out big players like Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB.O) and Wells Fargo & Co.(WFC.N)

Dorn said Tesla's ESG score had declined slightly from the ""22"" it received last year. At the same time the average score among other automakers improved, pushing Tesla out of the ESG index because of a rule against including lowest-quartile performers.

Dorn and others did not immediately describe other details such as the reasons Twitter or Phillips 66 were added or other companies dropped.

Among other big ESG ratings agencies, MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) gives Tesla an ""average"" ESG rating, while the Sustainalytics unit of Morningstar Inc gives Tesla a ""medium risk"" rating, according to the firms' websites.

119,Teslas Musk says he can no longer support Democrats will vote Republican,2022-05-19 01:34:55,"
SAN FRANCISCO, May 18 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that while he voted for Democrats in the past, he will now vote for Republicans.

""In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party. But they have become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican,"" he tweeted.

""Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold,"" said Musk, the world's richest man, who has agreed to buy Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).


The 50-year-old billionaire recently said he would reverse Twitter's ban on former U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, when he buys the social media platform. He also said Twitter is far-left-biased because it is headquartered in California, a state known for its progressive politics.

Tesla's stock fell 6.8% on Wednesday, after he announced his support for Republicans and Tesla was removed from a closely-watched sustainable index. read more

Tweets mocking Elon as being ""poor Elon"" were trending on social media platform Twitter, sparking his mother Maye Musk to weigh in with her own tweet to defend her son.

""Poor Elon might only be the 2nd or 3rd richest man in the world now,"" one twitter user said.

""Poor Elon. No liberals are going to buy his cars anymore, when there's so many nicer options,"" another said.

Musk's mother criticized some tweets for ""nasty comments"" and alleged they were ""troll or bot"", referring to fake accounts.

Musk has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration and Democrats for their proposals to tax billionaires and give more tax incentives to union-made electric vehicles. Tesla does not have unions at its U.S. factories.

Last year, Tesla, which counts California as its biggest market in the United States, moved its headquarters from California to the more politically conservative Texas.

Musk moved his personal residence from California to Texas, where there is no state income tax. He has sold about $25 billion worth of Tesla stock since last year in order to pay taxes and finance his proposed acquisition of Twitter. Analysts said the sales helped him cash in on Tesla's stock rally and diversify his wealth.

120,MakerDAOs Rune Christensen says Terra was long overdue to collapse calls for rules on stablecoins,2022-05-20 15:10:00,"The collapse of the stablecoin TerraUSD was a bittersweet vindication for Rune Christensen, CEO cofounder of the decentralized crypto project MakerDao, as he had a long track record of arguing that Terra’s model was fundamentally flawed from the beginning.

TerraUSD is an algorithmic stablecoin whose value was pegged at $1. In order to defend that peg, users of TerraUSD were always able to exchange 1 TerraUSD USTUSD, -11.85% for $1 worth of an associated cryptocurrency, LUNA. But there was nothing that guaranteed LUNA’s LUNAUSD, -6.67 value beyond the collective confidence of its holders, a confidence that vanished in short order earlier this month.

Founder Do Kwon last week on Twitter said he was ”heartbroken” following Terra’s crash.

Kwon announced what he said is a plan to “rebirth a new Terra blockchain and LUNA” on Twitter Wednesday.

MakerDao, built on the ethereum ETHUSD, -3.36% blockchain, issues the Dai stablecoin that is backed by a diverse pool of crypto assets. It is known as “overcollateralized” because users have to post more than $1 worth of crypto assets to get back $1 worth of Dai DAIUSD, -0.02% .

MarketWatch caught up with Christensen over video conference Thursday to get his take on the crypto landscape in the wake of the Terra drama and a broader decline in the crypto market. The interview has been edited.

What’s your take on what happened to Terra?

The model that Luna and Terra used, which is nowadays called the algorithmic stablecoin, was invented all the way back in 2014. It was sort of a theoretical idea that everyone could just tell by looking at it that it wasn’t going to work.

During the bull market we just went through, these types of stablecoins started popping up. Terra somehow managed to have more legitimacy and more momentum and actually grow to this massive size.

But it was still obvious that these models didn’t work. It was completely clear. You can’t create money out of thin air. You can’t back something with itself and expect it to remain stable.

It was long overdue to collapse, and it was a tragedy that it was allowed to get so big, in part because it had a lot of major backers who created more legitimacy for it.

Why do you think sophisticated investors were drawn to this model?

Greed allows people to pretend that 1 plus 1 doesn’t equal 2. The promise of being able to print free money is just so strong.

They probably believed there was a chance it could work. There are also some really hardcore public figures that supported Luna and have gained credibility because they actually lost everything. So some of them truly believed that it worked and held on to the end and lost everything.

But there were others…[who] may also have been smart enough to understand that it was basically a ride you only want to take on the way up.

The appeal of Terra was in part because it was decentralized, and there’s a lot of debate as to whether Dai can credibly be called decentralized. What are your thoughts on this discussion?

The Luna community in particular liked to attack Dai, saying it’s not decentralized because it uses USDC USDCUSD, , a centralized stablecoin, as part of its collateral.

The reason why Dai ended up doing that is because the original model that only used ethereum, it used these overcollateralized positions that ensure there’s always more ethereum than there’s Dai in circulation. The problem is you can’t control how much demand there is for people to bet on the price of ethereum.

The only way to scale Dai as demand kept growing was to add something you can easily scale, such as every time somebody wants to have more Dai you can just back it one-to-one with USDC.

From the perspective of single points of failure and decentralization, it’s not ideal to have huge amounts of exposure to just a single, centralized stablecoin. On the other hand it’s better than collapsing and going to zero. So in terms of the choices available, especially at the time when demand started to outstrip the ability to generate supply purely from ether, it was the right choice.

It’s always just a question of how to protect Dai users. Ultimately the holders of the MKR token MKRUSD, -1.23% that confers voting rights, their incentives are aligned with users of Dai because they have to backstop any losses that occur.

It’s obvious that you don’t want to have, whether its centralized or whatever, you don’t want to have all your collateral in a single token. So the community is working very hard to diversity out of USDC into coins like USDP, Paxos USD and Gemini USD.

Is this argument over centralization a productive one?

Centralization exists on a spectrum. You can look at different blockchains and some of them have hundreds of thousands of nodes and others maybe have 100 nodes and some have, like 20. They may all be decentralized, but they’re different levels of decentralization.

You shouldn’t really be thinking only about decentralization. You should be thinking about risk. Centralization isn’t the only type of risk you need be worried about, as evidenced by Terra, right?

It’s just one of many things that you need to consider if your goal is to create something that is stable, useful and relevant.

Where is DeFi going from here?

Now that blockchain has gone through these two major bubbles, one in 2017 and the huge bubble and crash we just had, I think we’re at the end of the honeymoon phase where people had this sense that something amazing is coming just around the corner that’s going to solve all the problems of finance.

The blockchain and DeFi still have the potential to make financial transactions much more efficient and cheap and major financial institutions and banks are working to get real financial instruments on the blockchain.

Societe Generale in France, for instance, is doing experiments where they have created these tokenized assets on MakerDAO, and we’re going to see what kind of benefits this provides.

See also: Prelude to the future of finance? SocGen is raising a loan from a DeFi protocol to refinance tokenized bonds

The collapse of Terra has brought into focus efforts in the U.S. to regulate crypto broadly and stablecoins in particular. What are your thoughts on this debate?

Before the Maker Foundation [which Christensen previously ran] was shut down because MakerDao became sufficiently decentralized to run on its own, we were eager to interact with regulators because we saw regulatory interaction and education as a cornerstone of making stablecoins work.

I’m a big supporter of regulation in general. Regulation exists for a reason and it can be a huge benefit for the space. If it’s done right it can be a huge benefit, it can create confidence and bring more people into the space.

Something like requiring disclosure of what’s backing a stablecoin, it obviously needs to be required by law. It makes no sense to create a product, call it stable and then say I’m not gonna tell you how it’s backed.

The space needs to grow up a little. It makes perfect sense for governments, if somebody is selling a black box and giving all sorts of promises about it, to bring protection to its citizens. It’s a financial transaction like any other and people shouldn’t be allowed to use the excuse that it’s blockchain, so we can just go out and cause harm to people.

121,Elon Musk visits Brazils Bolsonaro to discuss Amazon rainforest plans,2022-05-20 14:33:00,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Tesla and SpaceX chief executive officer Elon Musk met with Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday to discuss connectivity and other projects in the Amazon rainforest.

The meeting, held in a luxurious resort in Sao Paulo state, was organized by Communications Minister Fábio Faria, who has said he is seeking partnerships with the world’s richest man to bring or improve internet in schools and health facilities in rural areas using technology developed by SpaceX and Starlink, and also to preserve the rainforest.

“Super excited to be in Brazil for launch of Starlink for 19,000 unconnected schools in rural areas & environmental monitoring of Amazon,” Musk tweeted Friday morning.

Illegal activities in the vast Amazon rainforest are monitored by several institutions, such as the national space agency, federal police and environmental regulator Ibama.

But deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has surged under Bolsonaro, reaching its highest annual rate in more than a decade, according to official data from the national space agency. Bolsonaro’s critics say he is largely to blame, having emboldened loggers and land grabbers with his fervent support for development of the region.

During the event, Bolsonaro said the region was “really important” to Brazil.

“We count on Elon Musk so that the Amazon is known by everyone in Brazil and in the world, to show the exuberance of this region, how we are preserving it, and how much harm those who spread lies about this region are doing to us,” he said.

Bolsonaro and Musk appeared in a video transmitted live on the president’s Facebook account, standing together on a stage and answering questions from a group of students.

“A lot can be done to improve quality of life through technology,” Musk told the crowd.

Although none of the students asked about Musk’s prospective purchase of Twitter, Bolsonaro said that it represented a “breath of hope.”

“Freedom is the cement for the future,” he said, calling the billionaire a “legend of freedom.”

Musk has offered to buy Twitter for $44 billion, but said this week the deal can’t go forward until the company provides information about how many accounts on the platform are spam or bots.

Like Musk, Bolsonaro has sought to position himself as a champion of free speech and opposed the deplatforming of individuals including his ally, former U.S. President Donald Trump.

The meeting with Bolsonaro occurs just five months before the far-right leader will seek a second term in a hotly anticipated election.

122,Waves of online abuse buffeted thennewly appointed director of Homeland Security disinformation panel,2022-05-20 13:13:00,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Nina Jankowicz, like many of her generation (she’s 33), was excited to share a social-media post announcing her new job on Twitter late last month when she was named executive director for a new disinformation board established by the Department of Homeland Security.

But instead of well wishes, Jankowicz’s tweet set off a torrent of sexist profanities across social media and menacing emails filled with rape or death threats that continue to follow her even after she resigned from that new job on Wednesday morning following the disastrous rollout of the program. Republicans also raised questions about her fitness to serve in the role, given past comments about former President Donald Trump and his allies.

It’s a familiar scenario, not only for those who criticize Trump, but for many women.

In part, it’s also due to a confluence of social media, a hyperpolarized world and the crush of online harassment, stalking and abuse that has driven dozens of women around the globe from powerful positions. The speed and unchecked virulence of the attacks show another way that social media can serve as an accelerant to sowing discord.

“This type of silencing and terrorizing are global, sadly, and unsurprising,” said Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Virginia who studies online privacy and hate crimes. “It is a playbook. And it’s downright scary.”

“ Critics, prominently including Republican lawmakers, raised questions about how the board might infringe on Americans’ free speech and privacy rights. ”

In 2018, after winning an election that made her the first female, Black legislator in Vermont, Kiah Morris said she was quitting the job because of racist threats, including from one Twitter user who threatened to stalk her at rallies.

Former Ohio health director Amy Acton, one of several female health officials across the U.S. who was subjected to threats online after recommending COVID-19 masking and stay-at-home orders, resigned weeks after protesters showed up at her house armed with sexist, antisemitic signs.

From the archives (June 2020): Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine credits outgoing state health director with saving ‘many lives’ amid Republican criticism

Heidi Allen, a member of British Parliament, stepped down in 2019, saying she was “exhausted” by “vile” online hatred she received, which included one man who posted aerial images of her home with specific threats. He was eventually jailed for his posts.

A United Nations report released earlier this year that looked at Finland confirmed what many of those women already suspected: Female politicians, regardless of political affiliation, are subjected to 10 times more abusive messages on Twitter, including hate speech that sometimes suggested the women kill themselves. The online abuse, the U.N. concluded in its report, prevents democracies from being equally representative.

For her part, Jankowicz said Wednesday she won’t be “silenced” by the online harassment and it was not the final provocation that led to her resignation. But it had a similar effect.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas decided Tuesday to pause the work of the Disinformation Governance Board after such a negative reception and growing concerns that it was becoming a distraction for the department’s other work on disinformation, according to two department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The board’s pause led Jankowicz to quit Wednesday morning.

“ ‘It is a playbook. And it’s downright scary.’” — Danielle Citron, University of Virginia

To be sure, the board’s bungled launch and the agency’s ensuing struggle to directly answer questions about its purpose, funding or work made the new initiative contentious from the start. Critics, prominently including Republican lawmakers, raised questions about how the board might infringe on Americans’ free speech and privacy rights.

Others expressed concerns around Jankowicz’s statements during the 2020 election warning of possible Russian involvement around the provenance of a laptop said to belong to Hunter Biden, the president’s eldest son. A TikTok video she posted to the tune of a song from “Mary Poppins” calling the story disinformation was widely criticized by conservative media, Republicans and others.

Conservative pundits, Twitter users and TV show hosts delivered a relentless campaign full of sexist attacks and misleading statements against Jankowicz. A Fox News personality questioned whether Jankowicz should have agreed to lead the board while pregnant. One far-right extremist called her “mentally ill” and a “nasty … Jew,” on his podcast, though Jankowicz is not Jewish. Last week several conservative news sites circulated a misleading claim that Jankowicz was seeking powers to edit Twitter TWTR, +1.58% users’ posts directly.

“I was trying to do important work to protect Americans from a real threat,” Jankowicz said. But, instead, she was spending time reporting a steady wave of threats about herself.

“It was horrible. It was constant [direct messages], emails, threats on Twitter, threats on other places that I wasn’t looking at. That’s obviously really scary and really unpleasant.”

123,Celebrating that your job gets to live in your house rentfree Remote work has fueled US house prices during the pandemic  so what happens when people return to the office,2022-05-20 13:05:00,"Remote work has played a big part in the rise in house prices in the U.S. during the first two years of the pandemic, but just how much?

Many fortunate people have had the freedom to live wherever they choose during the pandemic. John Mondragon, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Johannes Wieland, an associate professor from the Department of Economics at the University of California, San Diego, published a paper this week with a bold conclusion: The shift to remote work explains over half of the 23.8% national house price increase between 2019 and November 2021.

The researchers wrote: “​​Our results imply a fundamentals-based explanation for the recent increases in housing costs over speculation or financial factors, and that the evolution of remote work is likely to have large effects on the future path of house prices and inflation.” The paper was distributed Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

The rise in house prices has pleased those who are able and willing to sell, but caused heartache for millions of first-time buyers who yearn to get a foot on the property ladder.

Home prices soared 15.6% year over year in April, reaching a median price of $424,824, according to Redfin RDFN, -3.64% . On average, the number of homes sold fell to 545,706, a decline of 13.2% from the prior year.

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.3% for the week ending May 12, according to data released by Freddie Mac FMCC, -0.05% . To put that in context: The average rate hovered at 2.94% a year ago.

A recent poll from Gallup found that only 30% of Americans believe now is a good time to buy a house. It’s the lowest level on record since Gallup began surveying Americans on this question beginning in 1978, and it’s the first time less than 50% of people across the country thought it was a good time to buy.

Housing costs — which can take up a third of a family’s take-home pay for a middle-income household — have increased by 5.1% in the past year, the fastest annual pace since 1991, while rents are up 4.8% from a year ago, according to the Labor Department.

Another speed bump for employers, if not for housing markets where people fled during the pandemic: There is a reluctance to return to the office among many employees. As one working-from-home employee wrote on Twitter TWTR, +1.58% : “Both of these things are true: the push for returns to the office is absolutely a capitalist death march/celebrating that your job gets to live in your house rent free without compensation is clown s***.” Another wrote: “We want people to return to the office so those building aren’t abandoned and he’ll be forced to house the unhoused in all them empty buildings!!!!”

A group that calls themselves “Apple Together” signed an open letter to the company, claiming 1,400 signatures from workers. “We are not asking for everyone to be forced to work from home,” they wrote. “We are asking to decide for ourselves, together with our teams and direct manager, what kind of arrangement works best for each one of us, be that in an office, work from home, or a hybrid approach. Stop treating us like school kids who need to be told when to be where and what homework to do.” (Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment.)

The latest NBER research details the relationship between remote work and house prices. “Using variation in remote work exposure across U.S. metropolitan areas we estimate that an additional percentage point of remote work causes a 0.93% increase in house prices after controlling for negative spillovers from migration,” the authors wrote. “This cross-sectional estimate combined with the aggregate shift to remote work implies that remote work raised aggregate U.S. house prices by 15.1%.”

But the rise in house prices could reverse as people return to the office. CoreLogic predicts that home prices will slow to a 5% growth rate in 2023, while Fannie Mae FNMA, +0.48% sees a more tepid 4.2% growth next year.

“Our results also imply that the future path of housing costs may depend critically on the path of remote work,” the NBER paper added. “If remote work reverses, then there may be a general reversal in housing demand and potentially house prices. If remote work persists, we may expect important repercussions as increased housing costs feed into inflation and so affect the response of monetary policy.”

125,Why did crypto crash Mark Cuban compares crypto lull to the early internet,2022-05-20 12:51:00,"Mark Cuban, billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, thinks that cryptocurrency is on the same downward trend that tech and internet companies hit in the early 2000s.

Bitcoin hit a 10-month low in May, and sales of non-fungible tokens, aka NFTs, plummeted between January and March 2022.

See also: Mark Cuban on board with Biden plan to forgive $10,000 in student loans: ‘It has to be fixed’

Cuban addressed the slump in a viral Twitter TWTR, +1.58% thread. “Crypto is going through the lull that the internet went through,” he wrote.

The comparison between cryptocurrency and the early days of the internet has been made by Cuban and others including entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk before. The dot-com bubble burst in 2000 after several internet-centric companies received high levels of investment speculation, only to eventually bottom-out.

Cuban sold his company Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for $5.7 billion, just before the dot-com bust. Broadcast.com has since been discontinued.

See: How a millionaire outbid a billionaire to buy the Golden State Warriors in 2010

The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner is heavily invested and interested in the crypto and NFT space. He claims to own several thousand dollars worth of bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.94% , ethereum ETHUSD, -3.36% and dogecoin DOGEUSD, -3.36% , according to a CNBC report, and also says that 80% of his investments that aren’t on “Shark Tank” are crypto-related.

But what’s next? While NFTs have exploded in popularity over the past few years, with creators like Beeple and NBA Top Shot selling NFTs for millions of dollars, recent NFT sales have plummeted as more creators flooded the marketplace. The average daily transaction volume on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, was down more than 55% from January 2022 to March 2022, according to crypto data tracking platform Dune Analytics.

“I think that early on, you saw lots of new entrants who were enthusiastic about this, but didn’t necessarily have a grasp of the fundamentals, and I think the cooling is a reflection of that,” Jordan Birnholtz, co-founder at NFT marketplace Neon told Distributed Ledger.

Millionaire Vaynerchuk, who invested early in companies like Facebook FB, +0.67% , Twitter, Uber UBER, -0.23% , Snap SNAP, -0.67% and Venmo, told MarketWatch in July 2021 that he, like Cuban, sees NFTs and crypto following similar paths as the early internet companies in the late 1990s.

“I view NFTs exactly the way I viewed the internet in 1999. Internet stocks and their valuations were through the roof, prematurely, and a lot of things collapsed. Meanwhile, eBay EBAY, -1.34% , Google GOOG, -2.43% and Amazon AMZN, -0.37% were all there,” Vaynerchuk said.

Cuban said somethings similar in a now-deleted tweet last January. “Watching the cryptos trade, it’s EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble. EXACTLY,” he wrote. “I think BTC, ETH, a few others will be analogous to those that were built during the dotcom era, survived the bubble bursting and thrived, like AMZN, EBay, and Priceline. Many won’t.”

Cuban’s latest crypto comments come as prices for many cryptocurrencies are plummeting. Prices for bitcoin and ether were hovering around roughly half their November peaks.

126,How racist policies and segregation marginalized Buffalos Black communities An entire generation saw little if any improvements in their lives,2022-05-20 12:42:00,"Long before a white gunman allegedly stormed a grocery store in a majority-Black Buffalo neighborhood, killing 10 people, the city bore all the harrowing scars of racial inequality: segregated neighborhoods and concentrated poverty, a yawning gap between Black and white homeownership, a lack of grocery stores in communities of color, and disparate health outcomes.



That segregation is part of what drew the suspected gunman to Buffalo Saturday afternoon, when he allegedly targeted Buffalo’s East Side and Tops Friendly Market because of the predominantly Black population living nearby. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul told CNN that investigators believe the gunman targeted the surrounding ZIP code because it had the highest concentration of African Americans within hours of his home in Conklin, as well as a business that was one of the busiest in the area. The suspect allegedly said in online messages reviewed by the Washington Post that he’d visited the store back in March, observing “many Blacks” inside.

The alleged gunman, who had allegedly endorsed the racist “great replacement” theory, had planned to shoot even more Black people upon escaping the store, according to local authorities, but surrendered once outside. He’s since pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder. Those killed in Saturday’s shooting included a father who was picking up a surprise birthday cake, a local civil-rights advocate, a retired police officer working as a security guard, and an 86-year-old who had just finished visiting her husband of 68 years at a nearby nursing home. All of the 10 people killed were Black.

“Redlining was used as an excuse to deny Black people access to loans, keeping them in neighborhoods with lower property values and little investment. White neighborhoods, meanwhile, were seen as more desirable and worthy of development.”

President Joe Biden called the massacre an act of terrorism.

“These actions we’ve seen in these hate-filled attacks represent the views of a hate-filled minority,” Biden said during remarks in Buffalo on Tuesday. “We can’t allow them to distort America — the real America. We can’t allow them to destroy the soul of the nation.”

But segregation and economic inequality are also aided by America’s policymakers, and a fact of life that people in Buffalo have been living with for generations. A 1990 study on the state of Black Buffalo led by Henry Louis Taylor Jr., the director of the Center for Urban Studies at the University at Buffalo School of Architecture and Planning, unearthed high unemployment, high poverty rates, and segregation on the city’s East Side. A 2021 study meant to examine three decades of progress for the city’s Black residents found more of the same.

“The changes in their lives over the past 31 years have been modest,” the study said. “During this period, an entire generation saw little if any improvements in their lives.”

“Redlining was used as an excuse to deny Black people access to loans, keeping them in neighborhoods with lower property values and little investment. White neighborhoods, meanwhile, were seen as more desirable and worthy of development.”

It used to be that Black and white workers in Buffalo shared the same residential spaces, even residing in boarding houses together, Taylor told MarketWatch. That changed with the rise of homeownership in the middle of the last century. Redlining was used as an excuse to deny Black people access to loans, keeping them in neighborhoods with lower property values and little investment. White neighborhoods, meanwhile, were seen as more desirable and worthy of development.



One neighborhood close to where the shooting occurred, Cold Springs, was once also described as undesirable for mortgage lending due to the “infiltration” of Black people, according to reporting from WKBW, an ABC affiliate in Buffalo, and maps created by the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation. The color-coded maps entrenched segregation, made it so that Black people could not afford to become homeowners, constrained wealth creation, and subjected them to a more predatory rental market, Taylor said.

“In the formula that Buffalo used — and every city uses it — as value increases in a neighborhood and a community, it becomes the node around which other aspects of neighborhood development occur,” Taylor said. “In the highest-value neighborhoods, you’re going to have the best institutions, services, amenities. The lower the value in the neighborhood, the more you will see less of that happen.”

“The color-coded maps in certain areas entrenched segregation, made it so that Black people could not afford to become homeowners, constrained wealth creation, and subjected them to a more predatory rental market. ”



But even as Black people were sorted into under-invested communities by policy design, not by choice, racists blamed them for the poor outcomes in the neighborhoods in which they lived. Today, residents in the East Side of Buffalo — which was further degraded by the construction of the Kensington Expressway in the ’50s and ’60s — experience higher hospital admissions, a lack of access to healthy, affordable food and a lower life expectancy.

“They see white neighborhoods and the quality of white neighborhoods as the work of white people,” Taylor said. “Then they say, ‘Those neighborhoods over there used to be great when white people lived in them, but when white people left and Black people moved in they messed them up.’ That’s the type of racist type of thinking that occurs.”

Add that to the belief that people of color are somehow taking jobs away from white people.

“I mean, it’s a kind of contradictory view that doesn’t make sense,” Taylor said. “The reason I think that they believe that is that there’s this association that exists between anti-critical race theory groups, the efforts to suppress the Black voters, and the rhetoric that comes from the Republican party. They feed these individuals.”

“The ‘great replacement’ theory stems from the false idea that a cabal of elites is conspiring to undermine, if not eliminate, white people via immigration policies. talking points echoed by some Republican lawmakers, candidates, and conservative commentators.”

The “great replacement” theory the gunman allegedly espoused stems from the false idea that a cabal of elites is conspiring to undermine, if not eliminate, white people via immigration policies.

Similar talking points have been echoed by some Republican lawmakers, candidates, and conservative commentators who are now drawing scrutiny over their claims that Democrats want to increase immigration to shift voter demographics in their favor. About one in three adults similarly believe there’s some effort afoot to replace U.S. citizens with immigrants for political reasons, according to an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll.



To be sure, Republicans have pushed back on assertions that their rhetoric could be somehow linked to the Buffalo shooter’s motivations, according to the New York Times. Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, however, wrote on Twitter TWTR, +1.58% that “the House GOP leadership has enabled white nationalism, white supremacy, and anti-semitism.”



“It wasn’t some kid just hating Black people arbitrarily,” Taylor said. “He saw himself as tied to a larger movement.”



In the aftermath of the shooting, some residents have been clear in saying they don’t just want political statements condemning the shooting and racism that allegedly motivated it — they want real, structural change, too.

“I could care less about what Biden said, I want to see action,” Toni Arrington, a hair stylist who was outside the Buffalo community center where Biden spoke Tuesday, told The New York Times. “I want to see our community actually get help. I want to see people actually be protected. We work, we pay taxes, we pay for our protection and we’re not getting it.”

Local racial justice activist Myles Carter similarly told local public radio station WRVO that “all these people coming from outside the community to speak on the people that died here, that were murdered here, I don’t think is appropriate when they haven’t been fighting for the for the Black lives that are still living, or doing what we needed from them to keep us from being in these in these bad situations.”

Anna Blatto, a research associate for the Partnership for the Public Good, a community-based think tank in Buffalo, said that it’s critical to hear people living closest to the problem about their needs.

“The policy recommendation really is: Bring people from those communities together, listen to Black voices, listen to the voices of folks who live in those communities, because they know their communities needs, they know where investment is going to be most helpful,” Blatto said.

127,Opinion The US isnt headed for recession Nor will it be consumed by inflationary fires,2022-05-20 12:09:00,"“Some say the world will end in fire,” goes a famous Robert Frost line. “And some say in ice.”

If ever poetry could explain the stock market, this may come closest to capturing the sour mood that’s about to deliver a seventh consecutive week of stock-market losses.

With half the world’s investors apparently spooked by rising prices and the other half worried about growth, there are precious few buyers standing ready to balance out the general gloom.

But while there’s almost nowhere to hide when stagnation and inflation collide, this economic adjustment doesn’t feel like the start of a lingering illness. Rather it has the makings of a temporary shock that – soon enough — will restore the economy to balance.

That hardly mitigates the pain of the last six months of stock-market SPX, -0.87% declines, but it doesn’t justify the grim warnings of a looming U.S. recession. Recent price spikes in food and energy have already started to sour consumer sentiment, making the Fed’s task of price stabilization much easier to achieve. Growth will surely slow from here, but it’s hard to imagine a sharp collapse in demand given that consumers and companies have rarely been this flush.

Disorientating

These are clearly disorienting times. After nearly four decades of declining inflation and mostly solid growth, few active investors have ever grappled with markets feeling the heat of such sharp price hikes. Other than the 2008 financial crisis, which is already 14 years ago, the shivering prospects of recession have been relatively brief.

It has been a long time since analysts choosing assumptions for their valuation models have faced such a quandary. Should they use the Fed’s long-term inflation forecast of 2%, when they know their car just took $60 of gasoline? Can the Fed really ease growth to its projection 2.0%-2.9% for next year executing what Chair Jerome Powell now calls a “softish landing.”?

Stocks have been falling because in this environment no one gets through an investment committee with sunny assumptions about either inflation or growth. Meanwhile, uncertainty around both sets of numbers means it’s hard to tell what’s cheap. When rates were falling reliably and earnings were predictable, it was easy to talk yourself into price-to-earnings multiples in the high-20s. Today, investors aren’t sure stocks are bargains now that the S&P 500 multiples are now in the high teens.

But the case for America consumed by inflationary fires just doesn’t stand scrutiny. First, U.S. consumer price inflation seems to have peaked last week, even if wage pressures still need watching. Second, if higher prices don’t force many summer travel cancellations, they will calm this year’s Christmas shopping frenzy even if supply chains aren’t fully back to normal. Third, and most important, long-term rates are holding steady even as short rates rise, suggesting markets believe the Fed will succeed in stabilizing prices.

It’s technically possible the U.S. will tip into a recession within the next year, but a lot more would have to go wrong. Amid the dark headlines, it’s easy to forget that unemployment has reached near-historic lows and workers quitting their jobs in search of something better near historic highs. Corporate capital expenditure is up as well as firms invest in more advanced technology and more resilient supply chains.

Plenty of risks

Just how much damage is done as the economy “downshifts” is hard to predict. If the Fed is to fulfill one mandate to deliver “stable prices,” it will have to settle for a lower level for its other mandate of “maximum employment.” Loan defaults will have to rise from their own historically low levels. The housing market will have to stabilize.

Meanwhile, there are plenty of risks beyond American shores that could weigh on the U.S. economy. Europeans now face dramatically higher energy prices as they tighten sanctions on Russia. Food-importing countries face much higher prices for wheat and fertilizer, too. In China, COVID restrictions undermined seen industrial production declined a shocking 2.9% last month threatening further disruption to global supply chains.

Many of these risks have appeared suddenly and unexpectedly, creating stiff headwinds for U.S. stocks. The irony is that the relatively sharp price shocks from supply-chain disruptions and commodity price spikes make it more likely that red-hot demand will cool on its own. Inflation rates may find a new range above pre-pandemic levels, but they will be lower and more predictable than they are today.

There may be more fire and there may be more ice. But the world will not end.

128,How to get free covid tests You can order tests now from the government,2022-05-20 11:20:00,"Americans can start ordering free COVID-19 test kits from the federal government once again.

The U.S. government is mailing out eight more rapid at-home COVID tests per household to people who order them through the United States Postal Service. You can order them online at special.usps.com/testkits or by calling 1-800-232-0233.

This marks the third time that the U.S. government has made a push to send free rapid COVID tests out to Americans through the mail. People were able to order free tests from USPS for the first time in January 2022, and again in March 2022. This brings the total number of free tests available to each household since the start of the program to 16.

“As the highly transmissible subvariants of Omicron drive a rise in cases in parts of the country, free and accessible tests will help slow the spread of the virus,” the White House said in a Tuesday statement.

The White House officially announced the third round of tests on Tuesday. But the ordering site was already live on Monday, with some people shared they had already ordered their free tests on Twitter on Monday afternoon.

Every home in the U.S. is allowed to order these tests, regardless of whether the residents ordered tests during the previous rounds of availability, according to the COVID.gov site. This time around, there is an order limit of two orders per residential address. Each order consists of four rapid antigen tests, for a total of eight tests, according to the USPS website. Your order will come in two separate packages (with four tests in each package), each with its own tracking number, and the orders will ship for free.

During the previous COVID test order windows, the free tests typically shipped within seven to 12 days of ordering, according to the White House, with most tests delivered by the USPS within 48 hours of shipping.

The Biden administration announced in January that it planned to distribute 1 billion free test kits to Americans, including 500 million available for ordering at COVIDTests.gov. The White House says that more 70 million households have visited the site to order at-home tests to be mailed directly to them. And to date, the administration says it has delivered about 350 million free tests across the country, in U.S. territories and military bases overseas.

And the latest round of free rapid at-home tests comes as U.S. COVID are trending at the highest levels seen since late November. The U.S. is averaging 95,813 cases a day, which is up 57% from two weeks ago, according to a New York Times tracker. COVID cases are up in almost every state, and the Northeast and Midwest have seen a particularly substantial uptick in new cases.

130,The capitulation model for biotech is a Category 5 storm the same as energy in 2020  why contrarians say the sector is a buy,2022-05-20 10:34:00,"If you want to know how much investors hate the biotech sector right now, consider this simple statistic: More than 25% of small biotech companies have stock-market capitalizations that are smaller than how much they have in cash.

“The market is saying a quarter of these companies are literally worth nothing,” says Jefferies biotech analyst Michael Yee, who recently published this insight.

That’s remarkable. That 25% is the highest in 15 years — higher than even during the agonizingly long bear market of the 2008 financial crisis.

Back then, 18% traded below cash. From 2010 to 2020, the number bounced between 3% and 11%, according to Yee and his team. He’s referring to small- and medium-cap (smidcap) companies, those with a market cap of less than $5 billion. These are the ones that tend to have no earnings and have early-stage therapies in testing.

“This is the worst drawdown we have seen in our careers,” says biotech analyst Charmaine Chan with the Cambiar Opportunity Fund CAMOX, -0.32% . “No one has seen anything worse unless they have done this for over 20 years.”

For contrarians, this kind of extreme signal suggest only one thing. The sector is a buy. While it’s tough to find any biotech experts who are bullish on the group (even Yee is cautious), I’m not the only one looking at this as a contrarian opportunity.

Category 5 storm in biotech

The macro analyst Larry McDonald at The Bear Traps report has a similar view. To spot contrarian buy signals, McDonald tracks a collection of capitulation markers he developed during the 2008 crisis. They tell him when a sector is so despised that it is worth buying, in the contrarian sense. It’s a “blood in the streets” indicator, to borrow from the old Wall Street adage that says we should buy stocks when there’s blood in the streets. His capitulation gauge tracks several technical signals, among other things.

“The capitulation model for biotech is a Category 5 storm, the same as energy in 2020,” says McDonald. “The risk-reward is fantastic, at least for a countertrend bounce.”

Look at how the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production exchange-traded fund XOP, -0.05% is up over 170% from its 2020 midpoint.

McDonald suggests the SPDR S&P Biotech XBI, +0.30% and iShares Biotechnology IBB, -0.13% ETFs. I suggest six individual stocks below with help from Yee and Chan. McDonald thinks the XBI could go up 20% to $83 in a shorter-term countertrend rally, and possibly rise 30% to $90 or more a year from now. Those targets are the 50- and 100-day moving averages.

Biotech experts disagree

People who know the space better than myself and McDonald aren’t on board. Yee, who has been cautious since last summer ahead of the big decline, thinks biotech will remain challenged for the year. “It will take a lot of time to heal these wounds,” he says.

There’s nothing broken about the underlying science being developed in biotech, or the prospects for innovation, he says. It’s just that stocks can stay cheap for longer than you expect. “Why would someone wake up tomorrow and say ‘I need to buy all the smidcap biotech stocks down 50%?’ It’s always tough to be the first one in the swamp.”

“I think it a little bit too early to be bullish,” agrees Cambiar’s Chan. “You need catalysts to change the narrative.”

Look for progress on these fronts.

1. More biotech mergers and acquisitions

“M&A would change the narrative, but it’s not happening,” says Chan.

There is a good case for it, though. “Big pharma has so much cash they could basically buy the whole smidcap universe,” notes Yee. Their cumulative cash balance has now risen to more than $300 billion.

“The CFOs of big pharma are looking at this carnage, and they are just licking their chops,” says McDonald. “You are probably going to see substantially more transactions down here.”

Yee expects M&A to pick up gradually, but he’s less optimistic than McDonald. “M&A is tough when markets are falling fast,” he says.

2. The FDA gets its act together

From baby formula shortages to drug-approval delays and terribly mixed signals on approval paths, the Food & Drug Administration has been a big source of problems and confusion for everyone from parents to biotech investors. “The FDA has become more unpredictable,” says Chan.

OK, it has had the distraction of the pandemic and the need to focus on vaccines and therapies. But now with COVID-19 winding down (hopefully), perhaps the FDA can refocus on drug approvals.

3. Broader market conditions improve

Investors continue to panic about inflation and recession, because they know the Fed can’t come to the rescue with the proverbial “Fed put” (stimulus to counter stock-market declines).

Since the Fed has taken the training wheels away from investors, they have to think through inflation and GDP growth on their own. So far, they’re doing a poor job since it seems clear inflation has peaked and we aren’t going into recession. Hopefully, they get up to the task soon.

Stocks to consider … or avoid

Chan singles out UCB UCBJY, -3.05% UCB, -1.85% , a Belgian biotech company. Its shares got hit hard in mid-May when the FDA dinged its request for approval of its bimekizumab therapy for the treatment of a chronic inflammatory disease called plaque psoriasis because of some manufacturing inspection issues.

Now it has to reapply, but the data supporting bimekizumab seem sound. It has already been approved in Europe, Japan, Canada and Australia.

She also likes the prospects for two other UCB therapies in late-stage testing for neurological disorders: zilucoplan and rozanolixizumab. Expect more data readouts and applications for approval in the second half of this year, possible catalysts.

Yee singles out Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, +0.32% , Fate Therapeutics FATE, +1.70% and Ventyx Biosciences VTYX, +3.90% .

Vertex has been posting strong revenue growth for its cystic fibrosis treatment trikafta (up 48% in the first quarter to $1.76 billion). It’s also showing good progress on pipeline therapies for cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, kidney disease, diabetes and pain. Its stock is down 14% from April highs of $292.75.

Fate Therapeutics stock has slumped 77% since August, even though there have been no negative developments, says Yee. Fate continues to show progress developing its natural killer cell immunotherapies for cancer. Fate doesn’t need to raise capital soon. It has a partnership with Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.17% to develop cancer therapies.

Ventyx Biosciences develops therapies for inflammatory diseases like psoriasis, arthritis, Crohn’s disease and colitis. It expects key Phase I trial data on two of them over the next four months.

The companies trading ‘for free’

Yee cautions against thinking companies trading below cash might get bought out simply because their science can technically be purchased for free. “They likely suffered from negative events,” he says. But he does have buy ratings on Olema Pharmaceuticals OLMA, -3.04% , which has around $7 per share in cash vs. a recent stock price of $2.10, and LianBio LIAN, -2.01% ($3.76 in cash vs. $2.47 stock price).

Olema is conducting early-stage studies of therapies for breast cancer. LianBio helps partners study and develop their therapies in China. It has a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY, -0.27% , for example, to develop a cardiovascular therapy there called mavacamten, approved in the U.S. Yee thinks this China angle alone is worth $13 a share for LianBio. It’s partnering with other companies to develop therapies for inflammation, respiratory and eye disorders.

“We appreciate sentiment may continue to be challenging on China stocks, but the company has plenty of cash to execute on the pipeline and ongoing trials including the lead mavacamten asset,” says Yee.

Note that these are tiny sub-$300 million market cap companies which can be quite risky in biotech.

Vaccine stocks

Moderna MRNA, -5.74% , Pfizer PFE, +2.93% and Novavax NVAX, -10.90% are way off the highs seen in the thick of the pandemic. But Yee cautions against getting too bullish on them. The reason: It seems like the pandemic is receding, and large vaccine buyers around the world have been opting out of purchase options and deferring shipments.

131,Elon Musk Seeks to Reassure Tesla Investors Over Twitter Deal,2022-05-20 10:26:00,"Elon Musk had a message for Twitter and Tesla investors. Fixing the social media company wouldn’t be rocket science.

Musk took to Twitter (ticker: TWTR) Thursday evening, perhaps to reassure Tesla (TSLA) investor about the planned deal, saying that Twitter won’t take up too much of his time. “I’m spending

Musk, of course, knows something about rocket science. He runs SpaceX, the privately held aerospace company that pioneered reusable rockets.

Tesla stock was up 2% in premarket trading Friday. Musk’s post on Twitter might explain part of the move. Tesla investors have been worried about management distraction since Musk’s initial Twitter stake was disclosed in early April. Tesla stock is down about 38% since then. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are off 15% and 22%, respectively.

“While the Twitter situation in theory does not impact the Tesla fundamental story, the distraction risks for Musk (perception is reality) are hard to ignore,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives on Thursday. The Twitter bid comes “at a time that the Tesla ecosystem have never needed Musk more with the worst supply chain crisis seen in modern history.”

Neither Tesla nor SpaceX immediately responded to a request for comment.

The overall market is stronger Friday. That obscures just how much benefit Tesla shares are deriving from Musk’s Twitter. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up about 1% and 0.8%, respectively.

Tesla stock is more volatile than the market. It tends to rise faster when things are going well and fall harder when investor fears rise.

Musk told investors, on Twitter, recently that the Twitter purchase was on hold pending his investigation into the issue of spam bots. Twitter believes spam accounts make up about 5% of daily active usage. Musk believes the number is far higher and said as much on a podcast earlier this week.

Investors don’t seem to have a feel for how the Twitter-Musk saga will turn out. Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) co-founder Gary Black ran a poll on Twitter and found that while some 16% of respondent said they would wait and see the survey results, about 10% of active respondents, those who made a call, think the Twitter purchase will happen at the original $54.20 price. Some 40% of active respondents believe a lower price is coming and 50% think Musk will walk away.

Almost 10,000 people voted in the poll. About half think a deal happens. The other half doesn’t. Tesla is the largest position in the Future Fund.

Coming into Friday trading, Tesla stock is off about 33% year to date. The Musk-related drama might be a part of that, but automotive stocks have been hurt by investor fears over inflation and rising interest rates. General Motors (GM) stock, for instance, is down about 38% year to date.

132,Tesla Loses Top Spot in Cathie Woods Flagship Fund Roku Is the New No 1,2022-05-20 10:15:00,"ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood is a long-time Tesla bull. Her 2026 price target for the electric-vehicle maker’s shares is $4,600. Tesla, though, isn’t the largest holding in ARK Innovation ETF anymore.

That distinction now goes to video streaming streaming service provider Roku (ticker: ROKU). It accounts for about 8.4% of ARK Innovation’s holdings. Tesla (TSLA) accounts for about 8.2% of the fund.

The rest of the top five holdings are: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) at 7.9%, Exact Sciences (EXAS) at 5.9% and Block (SQ) at 5.7%.

Tesla doesn’t seem to have lost its top spot as part of an explicit trading strategy. Recent stock market performance has changed the relative rankings. Coming into Friday trading, Tesla stock has dropped 27% over the past month. Roku has declined only 12%.

Tesla stock has been battered by the tech selloff. CEO Elon Musk’s potential purchase of Twitter (TWTR) also has become an overhang on the shares. Tesla stock is down about 38% since Musk’s initial Twitter stake was disclosed. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have fallan about 15% and 22% over the same span.

Investors appear to be worried about how much Musk has on his plate. He runs Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company and Neuralink. Musk took to Twitter on Friday to reassure Tesla shareholders than Twitter was only taking about 5% of his time and Tesla was on his mind 24/7.

The decline in Tesla stock, along with other high-growth names, has hurt Wood’s fund. ARK Innovation is down about 23% over the past month and about 55% year to date.

Investors have shunned the highest growth, more speculative stocks as interest rates have risen. High-growth companies generate most of their earnings far in the future and higher interest rates make those earnings worth less when discounted back to today. That’s one reason why rising rates tend to hurt richly valued stocks more than others.

Tesla stock was is up about 2.3% in premarket trading on Friday. Roku shares have gained about 2.5%. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose up about 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively.

133,This is the only grocery store in a three to fivemile radius Buffalo supermarket shooting made a food desert in a Black neighborhood even worse,2022-05-20 10:11:00,"The accused shooter who killed 10 people and wounded three others at a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo was fueled by racism, authorities say.

His targeted location, a go-to spot to buy fresh fruit, produce and groceries in an area with few options for food shoppers, was surrounded by a so-called food desert — and that, too, is a circumstance shaped by racism, anti-hunger advocates say.

Food deserts — a term for areas where few stores sell healthy and affordable food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture — “exist for two reasons: economics and bias,” said Joel Berg, the CEO of Hunger Free America. “The economics exist throughout America, in white and Black America. And the bias is unique to Black or Latinx America.”

A food desert’s “combination of economics and structural, systemic racism” is also powered by the “false belief that low-income people don’t want healthy food,” Berg added. “That’s just bunk.”

The temporarily closed Tops Friendly Market where the shooting took place is located on the predominantly Black East Side of Buffalo, a city in northern New York that researchers say is one of the most segregated cities in the U.S.

“The Tops market, which opened in 2003, is surrounded on all sides by neighborhoods where at least 100 households lack access to a vehicle and are at least half a mile from the nearest supermarket.”

The Tops market, which opened in 2003, is surrounded on all sides by neighborhoods where at least 100 households lack access to a vehicle and are at least half a mile from the nearest supermarket, according to USDA data.

Nearby those neighborhoods sit others who are at least a mile away from the nearest grocery store, according to the data, which was last updated in 2019.

During a Sunday press briefing, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said one of her concerns was the “access to food in this neighborhood. We now have a food desert.” “A lot of people in this neighborhood, they walk to the grocery store,” Hochul said. “They don’t have transportation.”

Tops, which said Monday it was “heartbroken over the senseless violence,” is arranging free customer bus shuttles to a different location, according to its Twitter TWTR, +1.58% account.



Meanwhile, Buffalo Community Fridges, a network of publicly accessible refrigerators where anyone can drop off donated food to feed hungry people, is divvying up an influx of monetary donations to its network members and to other community groups, according to its Instagram FB, +0.77% account. A post lists other local organizations where people can send donations.

Through a partnership with the state, people who need rides to go grocery shopping in ZIP codes 14208 and 14209 will be able to get $25 off rideshare trips from Lyft LYFT, -2.18% and $20 off Uber UBER, -0.17% rides to and from another Tops location, as well as a Price Rite. (More information is available here.)

“I understand that this is a crime scene, but as soon as we can get this store open and available to the neighborhood is going to be critically important to the well-being and the sense of getting back to normal,” Hochul said at Sunday’s press conference.

But the “normal” experience of grocery shopping can vary substantially by race, research shows.

“A ‘food desert’ is a space — a chunk of neighborhoods, a stretch of rural countryside or otherwise — where easy consumer access to affordable fresh food is difficult.”

A “food desert” is a space — a chunk of neighborhoods, a stretch of rural countryside or otherwise — where easy consumer access to affordable fresh food is difficult.

The Agriculture Department acknowledges there are “many ways” to define what a food desert is, and one way is a “low-income census tract with a substantial number or share of residents with low levels of access to retail outlets selling healthy and affordable foods.”

But there’s a racial component too, data show. For example, Johns Hopkins University researchers said in a 2014 study that supermarkets were increasingly scarce in Black neighborhoods. “At equal levels of poverty, black census tracts had the fewest supermarkets, white tracts had the most, and integrated tracts were intermediate,” they wrote.

One in five Black households is located in a food desert, the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. said last year.

Indeed, some advocates tracing the links between food access, race and income have said terms like “food desert” don’t fully apply and may confuse or mislead, because, they say, a lack of access to fresh, healthy, affordable food is the result of municipal decisions, corporate decisions and government subsidy support. A better phrase is “food apartheid,” they say.

“‘This is the only grocery store in a three- to five-mile radius. We were in a food desert, and I would like to say a food apartheid. This is an area, a gathering place for all of our community.’” — Rev. Mark Blue, president of the NAACP’s Buffalo branch

“This is the only grocery store in a three- to five-mile radius,” Rev. Mark Blue, president of the NAACP’s Buffalo branch, told NewsNation on Monday. “We were in a food desert, and I would like to say a food apartheid. This is an area, a gathering place for all of our community.”

Blue told MarketWatch he is thankful for Tops having a store, but noted the grocery store is smaller in comparison to other Tops in other, more suburban locations. There used to be more grocery-store options, he said. “Now through the lack of resources, people have to rely on fast food; they have to rely on the corner store,” he said.

The build-up of retail grocery stores just beyond Buffalo could have happened in city limits too, particularly in the neighborhood where Tops is located, Blue added. “I truly believe if there were more white residents in that area,” it could have been a different story, he said.

Food insecurity for Black households increased to 21.7% in 2020 from 19.1% a year earlier, according to the USDA.

It’s tough to identify the latest trends for food access and food deserts in 2021 and 2022, Berg said. Consumer-facing retail stores have faced all kinds of challenges to keep operating, but there’s also been the expansion of online grocery shopping — as well as expansions in government food subsidies — that could bring more fresh food to more places, Berg said.

But there are also the headwinds of high inflation, which are especially tough for lower-income families to absorb. Compared to low-income families in European countries, Berg said, low-income families here lack access to paid leave and free healthcare.

But at least U.S. families faced relatively lower food prices compared with their counterparts in Europe, Berg said. “If they lose even that, they are going to be even further shafted,” he said.

134,Ibonds offer mouthwatering yields  but there are some arbitrage opportunities available to investors as well,2022-05-20 10:10:00,"With the release of March’s Consumer Price Index, we now know that a risk-free investment yielding 9.62% is available as of May 2. I’m speaking, of course, about Series I savings bonds from the U.S. Treasury, which have lately been all the rage. To take advantage, all you need to do is open an account at TreasuryDirect.gov. Last year, it took me all of 10 minutes to open my account.

Read: Economy shrinks 1.4% in first quarter, GDP shows, but mainly due to record U.S. trade deficit

I first wrote about I-bonds back in October 2021. Since November of last year, these bonds have yielded just over 7.1%, which is pretty terrific for a risk-free investment. Unlike traditional bonds, which have been absolutely pummeled this year, Series I savings bonds are far safer—because you’re guaranteed to keep up with inflation and there’s no interest rate risk, meaning they don’t lose value as interest rates rise.

If you bought I-bonds in April, you were able to lock in the previous 7.1% interest rate for the next six months. After that, you’d receive the new rate of 9.6% for the six months that follow. Because the interest earned on I-bonds compounds every six months, your total return over the 12 months would be 8.5%.

Read: The silver lining of surging inflation: I-bond yields should climb above 9%

Thanks to these mouthwatering yields, there are some intriguing arbitrage opportunities available to investors. The strategies exploit the large difference in interest rate between I-bonds and other investments. The most obvious opportunity: Buy an I-bond with cash you have in bank accounts and money market mutual funds, assuming you don’t need to access that cash for at least one year. But here are five other strategies to consider:

1. Harvest tax losses among your bond funds.

Given the horrible drubbing bonds have undergone this year—and the worst may be yet to come—chances are good that you have sizable losses in many of your bond funds. If these bond funds are held in a taxable account, you can take advantage of tax-loss harvesting. By selling up to $10,000 of these bond funds and using the proceeds to purchase an I-bond, you can use the capital loss to lower your 2022 tax bill while simultaneously reaping a guaranteed return of 8.5% over the next 12 months—assuming you bought in April.

2. Cash out of existing CDs and invest the proceeds in I-bonds.

Selling certificates of deposits to buy an I-bond makes great sense, even if it means paying a penalty for cashing out of your CD early. For example, if you have $5,000 in a 12-month CD with an interest rate of 1%, you’ll earn just $50 of interest. The same cash invested today in an I-bond with a prospective yield of 8.5% would earn you $425 in interest, or $375 more. Even after paying any early withdrawal penalty on the CD, you’ll come out far ahead. Just keep in mind that I-bonds can’t be sold until one year after the date of purchase.

3. Buy I-bonds instead of prepaying your mortgage.

If you have a mortgage, chances are extremely good that your interest rate is well below 8%. The last time interest rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were above 8% was in 2000. This presents an arbitrage opportunity for homeowners. If you can purchase I-bonds yielding 8% or 9%, there’s no reason to pay down your mortgage early by making extra principal payments—at least not until you’ve invested the annual maximum in I-bonds, which is $10,000 per individual, $20,000 for a married couple and $30,000 for a married couple with a trust. The interest you earn on that I-bond will far exceed the interest you save by prepaying your mortgage.

The same logic applies to a home equity line of credit (HELOC). I’m generally opposed to using leverage, but it could make sense to borrow cash from your HELOC and then invest the money in an I-bond. According to Bankrate.com, many HELOC rates are still below 4%. Should the interest rate on your HELOC rise above that of your I-bond, simply sell the I-bond and use the proceeds to pay down your home loan.

While this strategy requires some effort—including paying attention to interest rates—the payoff isn’t insignificant. If your HELOC has an interest rate of 3% and you earn 8.5% on I-bonds over the next 12 months, you would come out ahead by $1,650 on a $30,000 I-bond investment, and that’s just for one year.

4. Run the math on student loans.

The average interest rate on student loans, both federal and private, is 5.8%. The average is 4.12% for federal student loans. The math that applies to mortgages and HELOCs also applies to student loans. Given the juicy yields on I-bonds, it may be worth making the minimum payment on your student loans and investing the rest in I-bonds. Again, this strategy could be reversed should I-bond interest rates fall below that of your student loans.

5. Consider building an I-bond ‘war chest’ for retirement.

If we’re entering a new era of higher inflation—say 4% to 5% per year—it may be worth raising an I-bond war chest. Unless the purchase limit on I-bonds is raised, building a substantial I-bond portfolio will take time. But such a portfolio can have many benefits, particularly for retirees.

Inflation is one of the great risks for retirees, and the longer the retirement, the greater the risk. An annual inflation rate of 5% over 13 years, for example, would cut the dollar’s purchasing power almost in half. Stocks provide some degree of inflation protection, but at the cost of sequence-of-return risk. I-bonds protect against both inflation and sequence risk. A sizable I-bond portfolio could provide income during the pivotal years just before and after one retires, when sequence risk is at its highest. Also, a substantial I-bond allocation could allow retirees to hold more stocks in the remainder of their portfolio without losing too much sleep. Furthermore, an I-bond could serve as a ready source of liquidity for spending shocks during retirement.

How to go about building an I-bond war chest? Say you’re married and 10 years from retirement. If you set up a trust, you could purchase $30,000 a year in I-bonds over the next 10 years. With some tax planning, you could increase that limit to $35,000 a year, because an additional $5,000 in paper I-bonds can be purchased each year with your tax refund.

That means that, all told, you and your spouse could purchase up to $350,000 in I-bonds over the course of 10 years, confident that those dollars will maintain their inflation-adjusted value. Should you retire with stocks at all-time highs, you could hold on to your I-bonds and sell stocks to generate income. But if stocks are in the dumps, you could begin liquidating your I-bonds, giving your stock portfolio time to recover.

135,States with legal sports betting Americans bet 125 billion since legalization,2022-05-20 09:38:00,"Over the weekend, Americans celebrated the four-year anniversary since the Supreme Court ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) doesn’t make sports gambling a federal crime, clearing the way for individual states to offer legal wagering.

After the Supreme Court ruled that the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act doesn’t make sports gambling a federal crime

Since the ban was lifted, Americans have bet more than $125 billion on sports — as of May, 30 U.S. states and Washington, D.C. now offer some form of legalized sports betting, according to the latest tally from the American Gaming Association.

In just four years, betting transformed from a taboo topic on sports television to the open discussion of gambling odds during halftime shows of games.

Ray Lesniak, the now-retired state senator from New Jersey who filed the first lawsuit against the federal government in an effort to legalize sports betting, said he acted to provide money for states, and protect consumers.

“I made a good bet for New Jersey and for America,” he told the Associated Press, metaphorically speaking.

New Jersey is routinely one of the states with the most money wagered on sports each month, frequently passing long-time betting hub Nevada for the top spot on the list.

Over $1 billion was legally wagered on this year’s Super Bowl, and about $3 billion was estimated to be wagered during this year’s March Madness college basketball tournament, both numbers more than doubled totals from the year before.

“When PASPA was repealed, I don’t think any of us would have expected how big the industry would be just four short years later,” Karol Corcoran, general manager of FanDuel’s online sportsbook, told the AP.

“It would have seemed impossible just a few years ago to reach such height,” Dustin Gouker, lead analyst for PlayUSA.com, wrote to MarketWatch in an email. “But with the expansion of sports betting over the past year it is inevitable that legal wagering will soar.”

DraftKings president and co-founder Matt Kalish said: “I got into this industry because I was always the kind of kid who liked to predict things, to compete with my friends and make predictions. For people that like to do that, sports betting has become far and away the No. 1 thing.”

The $125 billion wagered figure is nearly three times how much Elon Musk agreed to buy Twitter TWTR, +1.58% for, and represents a bigger number than the total market cap for technology giant IBM IBM, -1.54% . In layman’s terms, it’s a lot of money.

After expenses, sportsbooks generally keep less than 10% of the total amount of bets they handle. Over the first four years of legal betting, their revenue figure is $8.8 billion, according to the American Gaming Association (AGA).

A major rationale for the push to legalize sports betting was to protect customers from being victimized by unlicensed bookmakers, particualary those who operate outside the U.S. State regulations include robust consumer protections, with watchdog regulators ready to pounce when they see violations.

Sports betting has been, and still is, pitched to state lawmakers as a source of new tax revenue, a particularly tempting option in the trying financial times of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has generated $1.3 billion in state and local taxes since 2018 according to the AGA, but the amount many states keep is a mere drop in the bucket compared with their overall budget. Some states, like New York, tax mobile sports betting revenue at 51% — a rate that operators say is not sustainable in the long run. DraftKings CEO Jason Robins even posited that the introduction of sports betting to California could help address problems surrounding “homelessness and mental health.”

Bettors who used sportsbooks like DraftKings DKNG, -2.90% , Caesars CZR, +1.65% or FanDuel had limited betting options when legal wagering was first introduced — like picking the outcome of a game or player performance before the event started. Since then, the array of potential bets has spiked due in large part to a surge in live-game betting, where gamblers can react to events as a game unfolds and bet accordingly.

“The live-betting has been pretty popular since day one,” former FanDuel CEO Matthew King told MarketWatch in 2021 shortly after the product debuted.

And while the more established sportsbooks look to increase their share of the market, the amount of money it takes to enter the industry and compete continues to grow, to the point where many executives of leading companies say they expect some lesser competitors to either merge or stop doing business.

FanDuel’s Corcoran said the near-term future is about growing the industry and its individual companies.

136,Mark Cuban supports 10000 in student loans forgiveness It has to be fixed,2022-05-20 09:31:00,"“‘We don’t want this being a perennial problem. It has to be fixed. As far as how much should be forgiven, I’m good with the Biden proposal.’”

That was billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban giving his thoughts about the student loan-debt problem in the U.S. in a Wednesday interview with Insider. Cuban says he supports the proposal backed by President Joe Biden that would forgive up to $10,000 in student loans per borrower.

The comments from Cuban represent a stark contrast to his previous views on the student-debt crisis. In the past, Cuban said that student-loan forgiveness could boost the economy, but explained that the problem should be fixed by addressing the “ridiculous tuition fees” from colleges and Universities.

See: College enrollment is falling. Here’s how it could impact the economy

“Forgiving the debt is the worst thing you can do,” Cuban said in 2015. “Because all it does is bail out the universities.”

Cuban still maintains that forgiveness is a temporary fix, and the U.S. needs to find a way to get tuitions to manageable levels.

He also added an idea on Twitter TWTR, +1.58% of creating a single, four-year, tuition-free college in every designated market area, which Cuban says would force high-cost universities to lower their total cost of attendance.

In 2014, Cuban said the student-debt crisis takes money out of the economy because those hampered with large loans, particularly younger borrowers, are making loans payments instead of using that money elsewhere.

“That’s the same money that, when you graduated, you used to move out of the house or you went out and spent money that improved the economy and helped companies grow,” Cuban said at the time.

In 2020, Biden campaigned on the idea of $10,000 of forgiveness per borrower, but he has taken no action on the subject since taking office.

The comments from Cuban comes as Biden said on April 28 that he would release details of a plan that would addresses student-loan issues in the U.S. “in the next couple of weeks.” No announcement has been made yet, but Biden has stated that he is looking to forgive less than $50,000 in debt per borrower.

Payments on federal student loans have been paused since former President Donald Trump made the initial freeze in March 2020, in the early days of the pandemic — it was then extended twice by the Trump administration and twice again under the Biden White House.

The student-loan payment pause impacts over 43 million Americans, according to the latest data from the Education Department.

137,Opinion The worst of all worlds for investors What if higher interest rates and a recession dont tame inflation,2022-05-19 10:56:00,"There is a big debate about whether central banks will need to generate a recession to force inflation lower.

For the doves, such action is not necessary because the “cure for high prices is high prices.” And this, sort of, makes sense: With wages failing to keep pace with prices, consumers all over the world are already facing a massive squeeze on their real incomes. (Please see chart 1, below.)

Yet, not everyone agrees. As the once uber-dovish Adam Posen put it in a recent FT article: “If declines in real incomes drove inflation cycles, we wouldn’t need monetary policy. The whole reason you need policy-induced recessions is that real income doesn’t reduce inflation unless labor-market conditions ease.”

Read: A ‘summer of pain’ for the stock market

With transitory explanations of inflation now clearly out of fashion, Posen’s analysis leads us to a very gloomy conclusion: A recession may now be inevitable, perhaps even “necessary.”

And while the past few months have been painful for risk assets, there is no way a recessionary outcome is currently priced in. So far, in fact, the hawkishness of central banks has merely deflated the “COVID asset-price bubble.”

The lesson from the 1970s is not encouraging. The U.S., for example, suffered three recessions during that decade, with each downturn the result of a large spike in commodity prices, which killed real incomes.

But the underlying inflation problem never went away. Prices slowed during each downturn —as the commodity shock faded — but then reaccelerated, typically on a faster trend than before the recession. And this continued until central banks, most notably the Volcker Fed, engineered their own recession, raising interest rates sufficiently to put millions of people out of work.

In the 1970s, it eventually took extremely tight policy and mass unemployment to “break the back of inflation.” From an investor point of view, this was the worst of all worlds — countercyclical inflation (stagflation) that produced a persistent positive correlation between bond and equity returns.

So why didn’t the 1970s recessions “cure” inflation?

First, each downturn was relatively short-lived. Sudden price spikes cut spending power, but then real incomes bounced back. In today’s context, this is, sort of, good news because it points to a soft patch rather than a deep slump.

Second, workers secured higher wages even as the economy deteriorated. This effectively replaced one source of cost-push inflation (commodities) with another (labor). The whole episode is synonymous with “wage-price spirals,” essentially a power struggle between labor and capital. Productivity declined and society spent the next decade trying to figure out who should bear the burden of this adjustment, until neoliberalism (Thatcherism, Reaganomics, etc.) provided a definitive answer: By crushing worker power.

Up to that point, a young militant workforce was able to resist any sustained real-wage squeeze. And, at least for a period in the late 1970s, the private sector borrowed heavily and reduced its savings, which also delayed the moment of pain.

What does this mean today? Households and businesses can respond to the consumer price index (CPI) shock in three ways:

Spend the same in nominal terms and accept a reduction in real spending. The economy will slow, perhaps even contract, but things will improve once costs stabilize (though there is always a risk of “non-linear” effects, especially if unemployment increases and you get further rounds of contraction). Reduce savings, or borrow more, to preserve real spending power. This will limit the hit to the economy and inflation should eventually subside. But people cannot sustain this for long. Resist the squeeze by demanding higher wages. Real GDP and employment will remain resilient, but the inflation problem lingers, probably at levels that are inconsistent with central banks’ targets.

Central banks are obsessed with the third of these scenarios, which is why they are watching wages especially closely. While a 1970s-style wage-price spiral does not seem very likely — basically because our governments have spent the past 40 years dismantling the institutions that produced those dynamics — policymakers are clearly worried about the tightness they are seeing in labor markets.

The threat that wages could produce a more persistent inflation overshoot seems much greater in the U.S. (and, to a lesser extent, the U.K.) than in the euro area and Japan.

But in all jurisdictions, it is clear that the ghosts of the 1970s are causing central banks to constantly ratchet up their hawkishness, regardless of what is happening to economic growth.

Naturally, this is creating a really difficult environment for financial markets. Leading indicators are set to deteriorate, perhaps sharply, but inflation anxiety will linger, which means we are a long way from any dovish pivot from central banks. Even if this is not “the end of the cycle” — that comes later if inflation fails to settle at tolerable levels — the next few months could be ugly.

138,Musk denies he sexually harassed flight attendant Tesla shares sink,2022-05-20 19:30:11,"
Shares of the electric carmaker skidded more than 10% on Friday amid concerns that the alleged sexual misconduct and Musk's political comments could threaten to damage Tesla's brand and sales.

Business Insider reported on Thursday that Musk's private company SpaceX paid $250,000 in 2018 to settle a sexual harassment claim from an unnamed private jet flight attendant who accused Musk of exposing himself to her.


The article quoted an anonymous person who said she was a friend of the flight attendant. The friend had provided a statement as part of the private settlement process, according to the article.

""I have a challenge to this liar who claims their friend saw me 'exposed' – describe just one thing, anything at all (scars, tattoos, …) that isn’t known by the public. She won’t be able to do so, because it never happened,"" Musk wrote on Twitter late on Thursday.

Reuters was not able to verify the Business Insider account.

Musk and SpaceX did not respond to Reuters requests for comment on the Business Insider story or on tweets by the billionaire.

In a statement to Reuters on Friday, Business Insider said: ""We stand by our story which is based on documents and interviews and which speaks for itself.""

The sexual misconduct claims ""have the potential from a PR perspective to turn people off,"" said Guidehouse Insights analyst Sam Abuelsamid.

Friday's share drop knocked about $66 billion off Tesla's market value and put the stock at its lowest since last August.

The shares have fallen sharply since early April as Musk's plan to buy Twitter sparked concerns about distraction and as China's COVID lockdown measures hurt production at Tesla.

Ross Gerber, CEO of Tesla investor Gerber Kawasaki Wealth Management, said he is concerned that Tesla relies so heavily on a single person, Musk, but he believes his liberal clients will continue buying Musk's cars, even if they don't like what he says, since Tesla's mission is clear.

POLITICAL ATTACKS?

Business Insider quoted the friend of the flight attendant as saying that in addition to allegedly exposing himself, Musk rubbed the flight attendant's thigh and offered to buy her a horse if she would ""do more"" during an in-flight massage.

The flight attendant came to believe that her refusal to accept Musk's proposal had hurt her opportunities to work at SpaceX and prompted her to hire a lawyer in 2018, according to Business Insider.

In 2018, the rocket company paid $250,000 in exchange for a promise not to sue over the claims and included a nondisclosure agreement that prevented the flight attendant from speaking about it, Business Insider said. The news site did not name the friend or the flight attendant.

Musk, who is in the midst of a contentious effort to buy Twitter Inc (TWTR.N), said on Wednesday that he would vote Republican instead of Democrat, predicting a ""dirty tricks campaign against me"" would follow.

On Thursday evening, Musk first tweeted: ""The attacks against me should be viewed through a political lens – this is their standard (despicable) playbook – but nothing will deter me from fighting for a good future and your right to free speech.""

In the initial tweet, he did not specifically mention the allegations in the Business Insider article.

He also tweeted that the article was meant to interfere with the Twitter acquisition.

139,Analysis Musks ESG attack spotlights 35 trillion industry confusion,2022-05-20 19:00:16,"
LONDON/BOSTON, May 20 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's rejection of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) scores as a ""scam"" highlights how Wall Street's hottest investment trend that encompasses some $35 trillion in assets means different things to different people.

The chief executive of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) lashed out on Wednesday against S&P Global Inc (SPGI.N) after the electric car maker was dropped from its flagship ESG index while it added some companies whose activities are harmful to the environment, such as oil and gas producers.

Musk took to Twitter to express his frustration with the move ""despite Tesla doing more for the environment than any company ever!"" He added that ESG ""has been weaponized by phoney social justice warriors.""


S&P Dow Jones Indices senior director Margaret Dorn told Reuters that Tesla had been excluded from the index because its score declined slightly just as the scores of other automakers had improved. Tesla was not excluded because S&P executives decided to kick the company out of the index over a particular issue, she added. read more

While Tesla's cars contribute to lower carbon emissions, its ESG score had ""fallen behind"" in other aspects, such as poor working conditions at its U.S. Fremont factory, claims of racial discrimination and its handling of a U.S. government probe into multiple deaths and injuries linked to its autopilot technology.

Sustainable investing - taking into account ESG factors in portfolio selection - has exploded in recent years, reaching $35.3 trillion by the start of 2020, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance.

Half a dozen investment managers interviewed by Reuters said Musk's spat with S&P illustrates how confusion still reigns over how many investors and executives view the industry.

Some, like Musk, believe the ratings should reward companies that do the most for the planet and society. Others, including firms like S&P that produce the scores, say they are meant to show how much risk a company's stock faces from ESG factors.

This explains why some companies that are major contributors to climate change, such as Exxon Corp (XOM.N), are allowed to stay in an ESG index if they can show they are taking actions to reduce that risk.

""Ultimately ESG is a way of identifying and trying to quantify risk. So it's basically risk mitigation,"" said Chi Chan, portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. ""Effectively Musk is conflating ESG with sustainability.""

Mark Tinker, chief investment officer at Toscafund Hong Kong, said Musk ""rightly pointed out"" that societal and corporate governance considerations are being used ""for political driven cancelling"" and that a company's contribution to the environment can also ""mean what you want it to.""

""The whole thing is very subjective,"" Tinker said.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of the company or Musk.

S&P published the change in its ESG index on April 22. But it was not until May 18, a day after Horn wrote a blog post that explained why Tesla was excluded from the index, that Twitter users started disseminating it, catching Musk's attention.

Only a tiny fraction of the ESG's industry's assets under management - $11.7 billion as of the end of 2020 - are tied to S&P Indexes. S&P's influential ESG index rival MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) has so far kept Tesla in its bluechip ESG index.

It was not immediately clear if the exclusion from the S&P ESG index had any impact on Tesla's shares this week. The stock had already been sliding almost every day since early April, losing close to 40% of its value, amid concerns that China's COVID-19-related lockdowns will disrupt Tesla's car production and a potential economic slowdown and raging inflation will dampen demand for its vehicles. read more

Uncertainty over whether Musk will complete his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) has also weighed on Tesla's stock.

SCORE BREAKDOWN

S&P declined to provide a breakdown of its ESG score of Tesla, which is compiled based on scores of the company's various operations and practices.

MSCI also declined to provide a breakdown, but a May 3 copy of its Tesla rating sent to investors and reviewed by Reuters shows how its perceived poor performance on social issues took some of the shine out of the company's strong green credentials.

Tesla scored 9.1 out of 10 on environmental grounds, against an industry average of 6.5. This made up 30% of its total ESG score. On social issues, however, it ranked 1.4 compared with an average of 3.5, while on governance it scored 5.1 against an average of 3.2.

Andrew Poreda, senior vice president for Sage Advisory Services, an Austin-based investment firm, said as a Tesla investor he understood why the company's ESG scores were lower than they might have been based solely on the company's contribution in the fight against climate change.

""You can't live in a vacuum of just environmental or just social issues, they are all intertwined,"" Poreda said.

140,Bear market beckons as US stock slide deepens,2022-05-20 18:55:41,"
NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The stock market's brutal year neared a grim milestone as the S&P 500's slide on Friday threatened to leave it in a bear market for the first time since March 2020, fueled by worries over sky high inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve and future economic growth.

The benchmark S&P 500 index fell below 3837.248, a decline that on an intraday basis put it 20% from its Jan. 3 record closing high. Should that hold until Friday's close, it would confirm that the index is in a bear market – frequently defined as a drop of at least 20% from a closing high.

If history is any guide, a bear market would mean more pain could be in store for investors. The S&P 500 has fallen by an average of 32.7% in 13 bear markets since 1946, including a nearly 57% drop during the 2007-2009 bear market during the financial crisis, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.


It has taken a little over a year on average for the index to reach its bottom during bear markets, and then roughly another two years to return to its prior high, according to CFRA. Of the 13 bear markets since 1946, the return to breakeven levels has varied, taking as little as three months to as long as 69 months.

Reuters Graphics

The S&P 500 surged some 114% from its March 2020 low as stocks benefited from emergency policies put in place to help stabilize the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

That decline went into reverse at the start of 2022 as the Fed grew far more hawkish and signaled it would tighten monetary policy at a faster-than-expected clip to fight surging inflation. It has already raised rates by 75 basis points this year and expectations of more hikes ahead have weighed on stocks and bonds.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has vowed to raise rates as high as needed to kill inflation but also believes policymakers can guide the economy to a so-called soft landing. read more

Adding to the volatility has been the war in Ukraine, which has caused a further spike in oil and other commodity prices.

A few areas of the stock market have been spared. Energy shares have soared this year, along with oil prices, while defensive groups such as utilities have held up better than broader markets.

On the flip side, shares of technology and other high-growth companies have been hit hard. Those stocks -- high fliers during much of the bull market over the past decade -- are particularly sensitive to higher yields, which dull the allure of companies whose cash flows are weighted more in the future and diminished when discounted at higher rates.

Some of the biggest of these companies, such as Tesla (TSLA.O) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O), are also heavily weighted in the S&P 500 index.

Investors have looked at various metrics to determine when markets will turn higher, including the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street’s fear gauge. While the index is elevated compared to its long-term median, it is still below levels reached in previous major selloffs. read more

141,SP 500 tumbles on verge of confirming bear market,2022-05-20 18:43:15,"
Summary

Summary Companies Ross Stores plunges after cutting 2022 forecast

S&P 500 -1.97%, Nasdaq -2.61%, Dow -1.72%

May 20 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 tumbled on Friday, putting the widely followed benchmark on the verge of confirming it has been in a bear market since hitting a record high in January.

Worries about surging inflation and rising interest rates have pummeled the U.S. stock market this year, with danger signals from Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers this week adding to fears about the economy.

Wall Street opened stronger on Friday morning before turning sharply negative and adding to deep losses sustained earlier in the week.


""Any positivity is being sold in a very heavy and high-volume fashion, and that's very concerning,"" said Keith Buchanan, a portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. ""It feels like it's fear driven.""

The S&P 500 was on track to close down 19.4% from its Jan. 3 record high close. Closing down 20% from that record level would confirm it has been in a bear market since reaching that high, according to a common definition. That would be the S&P 500's second bear market since the 2020 global selloff caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier in Friday's session, the S&P 500 was down almost 21% from its January high.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) was last down 29% from its record close in November 2021.

S&P 500 bear markets

Weighing heavily on the S&P 500, Tesla (TSLA.O) dropped 9.8% after Chief Executive Elon Musk denounced as ""utterly untrue"" claims in a news report that he sexually harassed a flight attendant on a private jet in 2016. read more

Other megacap stocks also fell, with Apple down 2.7% and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) losing 3.7%.

Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors declined, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and industrials (.SPLRCI) down 3.5% and 2.4%, respectively.

Shares of Deere & Co (DE.N) tumbled about 14% after the heavy equipment maker posted downbeat quarterly revenue. read more

Recent disappointing forecasts from big retailers Walmart, Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) and Target Inc (TGT.N) have rattled market sentiment, adding to evidence that rising prices have started to hurt the purchasing power of U.S. consumers.

On Friday, Ross Stores (ROST.O) plunged over 20% after the discount apparel retailer cut its 2022 forecasts for sales and profit, while Vans brand owner VF Corp (VFC.N) gained 3.9% on strong 2023 revenue outlook.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are set for their seventh straight week of losses, their longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001.

The Dow (.DJI) is on track for its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression.

Traders are pricing in 50-basis point rate hikes by the U.S. central bank in June and July.

In afternoon trading, the S&P 500 was down 1.97% at 3,823.92 points.

The Nasdaq declined 2.61% to 11,091.22 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.72% at 30,714.43 points.

S&P 500's busiest trades

Expiration of monthly options contracts on Friday was likely to boost trading volumes and could also add to volatility, especially toward the end of the session.

About two thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.00-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.61-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and 48 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 10 new highs and 325 new lows.

May 20 (Reuters) - The head of French carmaker Renault (RENA.PA) could return to Japan in June for the second time in two months, a source close to the matter told Reuters, a sign of intensifying talks with partner Nissan (7201.T) on a planned carve-out of its electric vehicle business.

CEO Luca de Meo, could return to Japan for the Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi alliance's next Alliance Operating Board (AOB) meeting, the source said. The AOB is exceptionally taking place in Japan for the second time in a row to coincide with Nissan's general meeting, the source added.

This would be de Meo's second time in Japan in two months, after he recently spent several days with his Japanese partners.

Renault has left the door open for Nissan to join its plan to create an entity dedicated to electric vehicles, designed to improve its image as an EV company in the face of renewed competition.

Renault and its partners were pioneers in electric cars at the start of the previous decade, but they have since been eclipsed by pure player Tesla (TSLA.O) and the ambitions of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE). read more

143,Nissan Mitsubishi Motors unveil light EVs for Japan,2022-05-20 08:09:00,"
KURASHIKI, Japan, May 20 (Reuters) - Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp (7211.T) and Nissan Motor Co (7201.T) unveiled their first jointly developed light electric vehicles (EVs), aiming to draw more Japanese drivers to battery-powered cars by offering low-priced micro models.

The two Japanese automakers, part of an alliance with French carmaker Renault SA (RENA.PA), were once considered trailblazers in Japan's EV market but have struggled to attract customers and face challenges from fast-growing newcomers such as Tesla (TSLA.O).

""I'm confident that (the new vehicles) representing the alliance will be a game changer for electric vehicles in Japan,"" Nissan Chief Executive Officer Makoto Uchida said at an unveiling of the new models in the western Japan city of Kurashiki.


The automakers are hoping to leverage their presence in Japan's unique market for micro ""kei"" cars, which account for nearly 40% of cars on the road in Japan.

The three companies' alliance early this year detailed a five-year plan to invest $26 billion on EV development, including kei cars. read more

Nissan, which produces the Leaf and the Ariya electric vehicles, will offer its first light EV, the Sakura, starting at about 1.78 million yen ($13,891) after factoring in a government subsidy, and with a range of 180 km (112 miles).

Mitsubishi Motors, maker of i-MiEV electric cars, will release the ""eK cross EV"" starting from about 1.85 million yen including the subsidy, also with a range of 180 km.

Both automakers said they would start selling their new line-up of electric ""kei"" cars this summer.

""People who used to think that EVs are too expensive will become a little more interested in EVs and will be willing to give them a try,"" said Riho Suzuki, Nissan regional product manager.

144,Shanghai economy hit on all sides in April by COVID lockdown,2022-05-20 05:33:21,"
BEIJING, May 20 (Reuters) - China's commercial hub of Shanghai reported on Friday a broad decline in its economy last month when a city-wide COVID lockdown shut factories and kept residents at home, sparking concerns among foreign firms over their presence in the country.

Output of Shanghai's industries, located at the heart of manufacturing in the Yangtze River Delta, shrank 61.5% in April from a year earlier, the local statistics bureau said.

That was worse than the 7.5% drop in March and was the biggest monthly decline since at least 2011.


Shanghai, where plants of companies including Tesla (TSLA.O) and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (0981.HK) are based, accounts for 30% of China's key auto components manufacturing and 40% of its chipmaking capacity.

While Shanghai's COVID caseload has declined, and the city of 25 million people plans to normalise life in June, analysts say the spillover impact of its lockdown is far-reaching, raising concerns about China's role in global supply chains as many multinational companies could reassess their operational risks in China. read more

Even if the lockdown is lifted next month, curbs on overseas travel of its citizens and the risk of further Omicron flare-ups are stirring uncertainty, representatives from the European Chamber of Commerce in China said during a roundtable on Monday.

""Many companies and individuals are seriously considering their China presence,"" said Bettina Schoen-Behanzin, the chamber's vice president. read more

Shanghai's April retail sales nosedived 48.3%, significantly steeper than the 11.1% drop nationally and the city's largest decline since at least 2011.

That dragged down overall retail sales in the Yangtze River Delta, which plunged over 30%.

Property sales by floor area decreased 17% in January-April versus growth of 4.0% in the first three months. In April alone, sales sank 88%, according to Reuters calculations based on the four-month data.

145,Twitter to tackle Ukraine conflict misinformation with warning labels,2022-05-20 04:02:20,"
May 19 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) will begin placing warning notices in front of some misleading content regarding the conflict in Ukraine and limit the spread of claims debunked by humanitarian groups or other credible sources, the social media company said on Thursday.

The step-up against misinformation around Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation,"" is part of a new policy that outlines how Twitter will approach misinformation during crises.

Social media platforms have faced increasing scrutiny over how they determine and handle misinformation. Twitter has agreed to sell itself to Tesla (TSLA.O) Chief Executive Elon Musk, who has said he believes the site should be a platform of free speech.


The new warning notices will alert users that a tweet has violated Twitter's rules, but still allow people to view and comment. The platform will not amplify or recommend such tweets and retweeting will also be disabled.

The approach could be ""a more effective way to intervene to prevent harm, while still preserving and protecting speech on Twitter,"" said Yoel Roth, head of safety and integrity at Twitter, during a call with reporters.

The company will prioritize adding labels to misleading tweets from high-profile accounts such as verified users or official government profiles. It will also prioritize content that could cause harm to people on the ground.

Twitter said it defines crises as situations where there is a widespread threat to life, physical safety, health or basic subsistence. It said the policy would initially focus on international armed conflicts but is also intended for events like mass shootings or natural disasters.

""While the timeline for this work began before the war in Ukraine broke out, the need for this policy came into even clearer focus as the conflict in Ukraine unfolded,"" said Roth.

146,Elon Musk to meet with Brazils Bolsonaro says report,2022-05-20 01:39:31,"
SAO PAULO, May 19 (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and business magnate Elon Musk are scheduled to meet in Sao Paulo on Friday, Brazilian daily O Globo reported late Thursday.

The two will discuss a potential partnership on rural connectivity and deforestation monitoring, according to O Globo.

The meeting follows a meeting of the SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA.O) chief executive with Brazilian Communications Minister Fabio Faria in November in Austin, Texas. The two spoke about using SpaceX technology to bring internet to rural schools and cut back on illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.


According to the O Globo report, the Friday meeting will happen in an upscale hotel near the city of Sorocaba in Sao Paulo state and will be attended by several business executives, including Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) Chief Executive Pietro Labriola and the chairman of Brazilian lender Banco BTG Pactual (BPAC3.SA), Andre Esteves.

Musk will meet Brazil's far-right president just days after he said on Twitter he could no longer support Democrats ""and will vote Republican.""

Bolsonaro, who celebrated Twitter's announcement of its acceptance of Musk's initial bid for the company, has been trying for years to lure Tesla to Brazil.

In 2020, his son, congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, said he had met with the former charge d'affaires at the U.S. embassy in Brasilia, William Popp, to discuss a plan to attract the automaker to build a factory in the country. Soon after, Bolsonaro stated a desire to visit a Tesla plant on a visit to the U.S.

147,Musk says Tesla is on my mind 247 amid concerns about Twitter distraction,2022-05-20 01:12:40,"
SAN FRANCISCO, May 19 (Reuters) - Tesla (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk said on Thursday that ""Tesla is on my mind 24/7,"" trying to soothe investor worries about him being distracted by a Twitter (TWTR.N) deal that has depressed stocks at the electric car company.

Posting a picture showing a woman (Tesla) who is upset by her boyfriend (Elon) checking out another woman (Twitter), he said, ""So may seem like below, but not true.""

""To be clear, I’m spending <5% (but actually) of my time on the Twitter acquisition. It ain’t rocket science!"" he tweeted.


""Yesterday was Giga Texas, today is Starbase. Tesla is on my mind 24/7.""

Tesla this year opened its new car factory in Texas, and Musk's rocket company SpaceX has a launch site known as Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas.

Tesla shares have lost one third of their value since the billionaire disclosed his stake in Twitter in early April and sold $8.5 billion worth of Tesla stocks in a move seen to help finance his $44-billion Twitter deal.

Further hurting stocks are China lockdown measures that dampened Tesla's production and an exclusion of Tesla from a widely-followed S&P sustainability index. read more

Tesla bull Daniel Ives, an analyst at Wedbush, on Thursday cut the target share price of Tesla due to the China production disruption and warned of ""distraction risks"" from Musk's Twitter deal.

Leo KoGuan, a major individual investor in Tesla, on Thursday called on the electric carmaker to buy back shares.

""Tesla must announce immediately and buy back $5 billion of Tesla shares from its free cash flow this year and $10 billion from its free cash flow next year, without effecting its existing $18 billion cash reserves with ZERO debt,"" KoGuan said in a Twitter message to Tesla's head of investor relations, Martin Viecha.

Viecha was not immediately available for comment.

Last year, KoGuan, the third largest individual shareholder of Tesla, said he was investing billions in Tesla because he believes in Musk's ""great mission that I share."" He said in March that he was buying more Tesla shares, not selling during the stocks' dip.

148,Elon Musk denies sexual harassment claims,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business) Elon Musk denied allegations that he sexually harassed a SpaceX flight attendant in 2016 in a series of late-night tweets.

""I have a challenge to this liar who claims their friend saw me 'exposed' -- describe just one thing, anything at all (scars, tattoos, ...) that isn't known by the public. She won't be able to do so, because it never happened,"" the Tesla and SpaceX CEO tweeted early Friday morning.

The tweet comes after Business Insider reported that SpaceX paid a $250,000 settlement in 2018 after a SpaceX flight attendant alleged sexual misconduct against the billionaire.

Nicholas Carlson, the editor-in-chief of Insider, the parent publication of Business Insider, responded to Musk's denial on Twitter.

""We stand by our story, which is based on documents and interviews and speaks for itself,"" a tweeted statement reads

Citing documents and interviews it conducted, Business Insider reported that ""the attendant worked as a member of the cabin crew on a contract basis for SpaceX's corporate jet fleet. She accused Musk of exposing his erect penis to her, rubbing her leg without consent, and offering to buy her a horse in exchange for an erotic massage.""

In his request to Insider for more time to respond to the allegations, Musk said there was ""a lot more to this story.""

""If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light,"" he told Business Insider. The outlet also said Musk characterized the story as a ""politically motivated hit piece.""

In separate tweets, Musk later denied that he ever responded to Business Insider while they were reporting the story and attempted to link the article to his Thursday announcement that he ""will vote Republican"" and his attempt to acquire Twitter — a deal he recently put ""on hold.""

""Did you actually respond to the reporters from BI?"" one user tweeted at Musk.

""No,"" Musk responded , ""it was clear that their only goal was a hit price (sic) to interfere with the Twitter acquisition. The story was written before they even talked to me.""

""They began brewing attacks of all kinds as soon as the Twitter acquisition was announced,"" Musk added in a separate tweet . ""In my 30 year career, including the entire MeToo era, there's nothing to report, but, as soon as I say I intend to restore free speech to Twitter & vote Republican, suddenly there is.""

The publication reached out to Musk about the story in question before he tweeted about voting Republican, according to John Cook, the investigations editor at Insider.

""For those interested, we reached out to the principals for comment regarding this story at ~9 a.m. eastern yesterday (Wednesday May 18),"" Cook said on Twitter

Musk's tweet declaring his voting intentions was posted at 2:44 pm ET on Wednesday , though he also made comments to that effect in a virtual interview posted to YouTube on May 16.

The Business Insider article states that it ""extended the deadline and reiterated the offer to Musk to comment on the claims. He did not respond.""

149,US banks 2021 hiring show lenders are seeking talent far beyond Wall Street,2022-05-19 19:12:16,"
NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - More than half of the new employees banks and other financial services companies hired in 2021 are based in Orlando, Dallas and other cities - far from Wall Street - as the battle for talent pushed companies to cast a wider net for candidates, according to a study published on Thursday.

Global real estate management company JLL, which manages office buildings for many of the world's biggest banks, found that 51% of all finance jobs filled last year were in Orlando, Dallas, Austin, Tampa, Indianapolis, Nashville, Seattle, Charlotte, Atlanta and Miami.

This marks a notable shift from before the pandemic when financial firms were just beginning to build hubs in secondary markets like Salt Lake City and Charlotte, the report said.


Dallas and Austin saw more than 6% growth in the financial services sector in 2021, with nearly half a million people working in that field in those cities.

Banks are facing stiff competition when hiring for technical and management jobs, said Sanjay Rishi, the head of JLL's Americas works business. read more

""The drive to find talent is the big challenge,"" Rishi said. ""They have to source it from not just the traditional cities they have sourced from, but also these tech cities like Austin.""

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Hewlett Packard Enterprise all moved headquarters to Austin in recent years from higher-tax states like California. read more

The shift in recruitment patterns are occurring as some Republican states like Texas target corporate practices that lean on or take sides on progressive cultural themes like fossil fuel lending curbs.

Last year, Texas banned state entities from working with companies that discriminate against firearms or fossil fuel companies, leading some banks to pull back from the municipal bond business there. read more

More recently, companies like Citigroup Inc (C.N) have started covering travel costs for U.S. employees seeking to access abortion services outside states where it is tightly restricted. L2N2VJ2DE

150,Oklahoma abortion ban Starbucks Amazon to cover employee abortion travel costs,2022-05-20 15:06:00,"Starbucks SBUX, +0.65% is one of the latest companies to offer reimbursement to their employees for travel costs when they seek reproductive care in other states, including abortion.

The benefit will be available to any employee who cannot access these services within 100 miles of where they live, and also applies to the dependents of the family.

Several other major companies, including Tesla, Citigroup, Yelp, Lyft, Levi’s, and Amazon, have also announced that they would cover travel expenses for workers with limited access to safe abortion procedures in their home states. Such moves from companies come as abortion rights in the U.S. are under pressure.

Several states, including Texas and Oklahoma, passed restrictive abortion laws in recent years —Oklahoma lawmakers recently approved a bill that would prohibit all abortions with only some exceptions. Tesla moved its corporate headquarters from Silicon Valley to Texas last year.

Additionally, a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court may look to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that legalized abortion in 1973. This has spurred questions about what happens next, including which states (and countries) would still allow abortion, as well as which states would “trigger” a ban on abortion if the ruling is overturned.

In fact, “Can you travel to another state for an abortion?” was a breakout Google search in the day following the leaked Roe v. Wade draft opinion, which means the search term spiked by more than 5,000%.

But some Republicans have called out companies for reimbursing workers who travel for reproductive care, like abortion, or for gender-affirming care. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently proposed legislation that would prohibit employers from deducting expenses related to their employees’ abortion travel costs, or gender-affirming care for young children of their employees.

These are some of the companies that have said they will cover travel costs for their employees seeking abortions, and how much some of them will reimburse.

Amazon

On Monday prior to the Supreme Court leak, Amazon AMZN, -0.26% told staff that the company will cover travel expenses for all non-life-threatening medical treatments, including abortions. The e-commerce giant, which is the second-largest private employer in the U.S. behind Walmart WMT, -0.05% , said it will reimburse up to $4,000 per year for such expenses.

The new benefit is effective retroactively to Jan. 1, and applies when the procedure is unavailable within 100 miles of the employee’s home, and virtual care is not possible. It is open to U.S. employees (including warehouse and office workers) or covered dependents enrolled in Premera or Aetna health plans.

Citigroup

Citigroup C, -0.86% also began covering travel expenses earlier this year for U.S. employees forced to go out of state for abortions. About 8,500 of the banking giant’s 65,000 U.S. employees are in Texas, which has banned abortions in the state after about six weeks of pregnancy.

“In response to changes in reproductive health care laws in certain states in the U.S., beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources,” the company said in an April filing.

DoorDash

DoorDash DASH, -2.23% also said it will begin covering travel expenses for abortion procedures after the Supreme Court document was leaked.

“It’s paramount that all DoorDash employees and their dependents covered on our health plans have access to safe, timely healthcare. This is one of our guiding principles as an employer,” a DoorDash spokesperson told MarketWatch. “Because safe abortion procedures may become severely limited in more states, DoorDash will cover certain travel-related expenses for employees who face new barriers to access and need to travel out of state for abortion-related care.”

Levi Strauss

Clothing-maker Levi Strauss LEVI, -1.04% announced Wednesday that the company will also cover travel costs for medical procedures that cannot be performed in the state their employees are in, which includes abortion.

The company says employees are “eligible for reimbursement for healthcare-related travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including those related to reproductive health care and abortion.”

Levi Strauss also noted that its employees are particularly impacted by the issue of reproductive rights, as 58% of the company’s global workforce is female. “Given what is at stake, business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees,” the company added in its announcement. “That means protecting reproductive rights.”

Microsoft

Microsoft says it will “continue to do everything we can under the law to protect our employees’ rights and support employees” in accessing critical healthcare. Those protections includes services like abortion and gender-affirming care, in the U.S., a Microsoft official told Reuters.

“This support is being extended to include travel expense assistance for these and other medical services where access to care is limited in availability in an employee’s home geographic region,” the statement continued.

Starbucks

Starbucks says employees and their dependents who are seeking reproductive health care can get it on no matter where they live, even if they have to travel for it. The benefit will apply to anyone who cannot access these services within 100 miles of where they live, and this also applies to workers’ dependents.

“Regardless of what the Supreme Court ends up deciding, we will always ensure our partners have access to quality healthcare,” wrote Sara Kelly, acting executive vice president of partner resources, in a letter posted to the Starbucks site. “Whatever healthcare choice you believe is right for you and your family, you deserve access to those services and the benefits that Starbucks provides.”

Tesla

The “People and Culture” portion of Tesla’s newly released 2021 Impact Report notes that the company wants its benefits to exceed the standards of the manufacturing industry. And that includes an expanded Safety Net program and health insurance offering that covers travel and lodging support for Tesla employees “who may need to seek healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state.”

While CEO Elon Musk did not immediately comment, he tweeted in September that he believes “government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics.”

Yelp

Yelp YELP, -0.53% , the crowd-sourced reviews platform, will cover travel expenses for both employees and their dependents who need to go out-of-state for abortions. Yelp has 4,000 employees, including 200 workers in Texas.

Yelp employees can submit the receipts for their travel expenses directly to their health insurance company, so “no one else at Yelp is ever going to know who is accessing this, or how or when, and it will be a reimbursement that comes through the insurance provider directly,” Yelp’s chief diversity officer, Miriam Warren, said in April.

“We’ve long been a strong advocate for equality in the workplace, and believe that gender equality cannot be achieved if women’s healthcare rights are restricted,” Warren also said in a statement at the time.

Other ways companies are supporting abortion access

Ride-sharing service Lyft LYFT, -2.26% announced in April that it will pay any legal fees for its drivers if they are sued for bringing women to clinics to receive abortions, which came as a result of the strict anti-abortion bills in Oklahoma and Texas. The Oklahoma bill, for example, would allow a person to sue another individual who “knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion.”

“This law is incompatible with people’s basic rights to privacy, our community guidelines, the spirit of rideshare, and our values as a company,” Lyft wrote in a blog post.

Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of competitor Uber UBER, -0.24% , tweeted that his company would support its drivers in the same way.

In 2021, Texas-based dating-app company Bumble, which prides itself on being women-founded and women-led, created a relief fund supporting the reproductive rights of women and people across the gender spectrum who seek abortions in the state.

And Match.com’s MTCH, +1.47% CEO Shar Dubey (not the company itself) also created a fund to help Match employees in Texas to seek abortions outside the state at around the same time.

Salesforce CRM, +2.03% CEO Marc Benioff also said in 2021 that the company would cover relocation costs for its Texas employees impacted by the state’s restrictive abortion laws.

“If you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state, Salesforce will help relocate you and members of your immediate family,” a Salesforce company memo stated.

152,Abortion polling What percentage of Americans support Roe v Wade,2022-05-20 14:56:00,"The United States Supreme Court may be looking to strike down Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion ruling from 1973, according to a now-authenticated leaked draft majority opinion published on Politico.

“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion draft. “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” he went on to say, citing a 1992 case that affirmed the 1973 Supreme Court decision.

With the possibility that Roe v. Wade could be overturned, it’s worth taking a look at how Americans feel about the ruling, and about abortion as an issue.

The polling data is pretty clear that a majority of Americans think that Roe v. Wade should not be overturned. According to a January poll from CNN, 69% of Americans want to keep Roe v. Wade intact, while just 30% want the ruling completely overturned.

See also: Starbucks says it will cover abortion travel costs for employees, joining Amazon, Tesla

This position is not a recent change, either, as support has remained fairly consistent for more than 20 years. Since 1989, between 52% and 66% of U.S. adults have said they want Roe v. Wade to remain, according to polling conducted and compiled by Gallup.

And according to data compiled by FiveThirtyEight from Pew, Gallup, the Kaiser Family Foundation and YouGov, roughly 10% to 15% of Americans think abortion should be illegal in all cases, about 25% to 30% want abortion to be legal in all cases, and 55% to 65% tell pollsters that they want abortion to be legal in some or most cases.

When asked if abortion should be legal in the first trimester, 61% of Americans agree, a slight drop from the 69% of Americans who say they support Roe v. Wade. A majority of Americans also say that abortions in the second and third trimesters should be illegal in almost all cases, according to AP-NORC data.

Only 1.3% of abortions are performed at 21 weeks of gestation or later, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Abortion is a complex issue that is often reduced to two sides, but Americans’ feelings on the matter are more nuanced.

“What it speaks to is the fact that the debate is dominated by the extreme positions on both sides,” Barbara Carvalho, a pollster at Marist, said in 2019. “People do see the issue as very complicated, very complex. Their positions don’t fall along one side or the other.”

Some political analysts have argued that any attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade by the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could result in a boost for Democratic turnout in November’s midterm elections, but voters in recent years have not identified abortion as a top issue. Among registered voters in the 2020 election, abortion ranked 12th highest on a list of issues “very important” to their vote, according to Pew Research, behind other issues such as climate change, gun control and immigration.

The idea of overturning Roe v. Wade has already drawn pushback from Democrats, including President Biden, who responded to the news by calling for voters to “elect pro-choice officials this November,” and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who indicated he would hold a vote on legislation to codify the right to an abortion into federal law.

Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, criticized the leak of the document more broadly instead of its contents, calling it a “toxic stunt.”

153,Tesla cut from SP 500 ESG Index and Elon Musk tweets his fury,2022-05-19 16:13:27,"
In it changes, effective May 2, the sustainability index also added soon-to-be-Musk-controlled Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) while dropping Delta Air Lines and Chevron Corp, according to an announcement.

The back-and-forth over the index changes reflects a wider debate about the metrics used to judge corporate performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, a growing area of investing.


Tesla has become the most valuable auto industry company by pioneering EVs and expanding into battery storage for electric grids and solar-power systems.

Factors contributing to its departure from the index included Tesla's lack of published details related to its low carbon strategy or business conduct codes, said Margaret Dorn, S&P Dow Jones Indices' head of ESG indices for North America, in an interview.

Even though Tesla's products help cut planet-warming emissions, Dorn said, its other issues and lack of disclosures relative to industry peers should raise concerns for investors looking to judge the company across environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.

""You can't just take a company's mission statement at face value, you have to look at their practices across all those key dimensions,"" she said.

Tesla representatives did not immediately respond to questions. The company has previously called ESG methodologies ""fundamentally flawed.""

Musk tweeted that ""Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list! ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.""

loading

Asked about the tweet, a representative for the index provider said Musk may have been referring to a list on a company blog post of the largest 10 constituents by market cap of the S&P 500 ESG Index after the removal of Tesla and others. The list is ""not a ranking of best companies by ESG score,"" the representative said.

Exxon now accounts for 1.443% of the weight of the index. Apple Inc was the largest at 9.657%.

GROWING CONCERNS

Investors concerned about issues like diversity and climate change have poured billions of dollars into funds using ESG criteria to pick stocks, prompting debate about how effectively the funds promote change or whether they push companies too much on issues that should be settled by government policy.

S&P Dow Jones Indices is majority-owned by S&P Global Inc. (SPGI.N) Musk and others have complained the firm and its rivals conflate too many issues by bundling ESG concerns into one total score.

For instance a fund based on the S&P 500 ESG Index, the SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF, received the low rating ""D"" by climate activist research group As You Sow, which noted despite its title and sustainability mandate, fossil fuel stocks make up 6.5% of fund assets.

In the company blog post reviewing changes from April 22, S&P's Dorn said the index aims to keep industries weighted the same as they are in the regular S&P 500 index ""while enhancing the overall sustainability profile of the index."" In practice that means it can keep oil companies while leaving out big players like Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB.O) and Wells Fargo & Co.(WFC.N)

Dorn said Tesla's ESG score had declined slightly from the ""22"" it received last year. At the same time the average score among other automakers improved, pushing Tesla out of the ESG index because of a rule against including lowest-quartile performers.

Dorn and others did not immediately describe other details such as the reasons Twitter or Phillips 66 were added or other companies dropped.

Among other big ESG ratings agencies, MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) gives Tesla an ""average"" ESG rating, while the Sustainalytics unit of Morningstar Inc gives Tesla a ""medium risk"" rating, according to the firms' websites.

154,Elon Musk visits Brazils Bolsonaro to discuss Amazon rainforest plans,2022-05-20 14:33:00,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Tesla and SpaceX chief executive officer Elon Musk met with Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday to discuss connectivity and other projects in the Amazon rainforest.

The meeting, held in a luxurious resort in Sao Paulo state, was organized by Communications Minister Fábio Faria, who has said he is seeking partnerships with the world’s richest man to bring or improve internet in schools and health facilities in rural areas using technology developed by SpaceX and Starlink, and also to preserve the rainforest.

“Super excited to be in Brazil for launch of Starlink for 19,000 unconnected schools in rural areas & environmental monitoring of Amazon,” Musk tweeted Friday morning.

Illegal activities in the vast Amazon rainforest are monitored by several institutions, such as the national space agency, federal police and environmental regulator Ibama.

But deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has surged under Bolsonaro, reaching its highest annual rate in more than a decade, according to official data from the national space agency. Bolsonaro’s critics say he is largely to blame, having emboldened loggers and land grabbers with his fervent support for development of the region.

During the event, Bolsonaro said the region was “really important” to Brazil.

“We count on Elon Musk so that the Amazon is known by everyone in Brazil and in the world, to show the exuberance of this region, how we are preserving it, and how much harm those who spread lies about this region are doing to us,” he said.

Bolsonaro and Musk appeared in a video transmitted live on the president’s Facebook account, standing together on a stage and answering questions from a group of students.

“A lot can be done to improve quality of life through technology,” Musk told the crowd.

Although none of the students asked about Musk’s prospective purchase of Twitter, Bolsonaro said that it represented a “breath of hope.”

“Freedom is the cement for the future,” he said, calling the billionaire a “legend of freedom.”

Musk has offered to buy Twitter for $44 billion, but said this week the deal can’t go forward until the company provides information about how many accounts on the platform are spam or bots.

Like Musk, Bolsonaro has sought to position himself as a champion of free speech and opposed the deplatforming of individuals including his ally, former U.S. President Donald Trump.

The meeting with Bolsonaro occurs just five months before the far-right leader will seek a second term in a hotly anticipated election.

155,Renault unveils hydrogenpowered prototype SUV in race to cleaner driving,2022-05-19 08:52:59,"
PARIS, May 19 (Reuters) - Renault (RENA.PA) unveiled on Thursday a prototype hydrogen fuel cell-powered sports utility vehicle (SUV), as the French carmaker scrambles to catch up with rivals in the race to cleaner driving.

Renault said the car, dubbed the 'Scenic Vision', would not be commercially available before 2030-2032. A fully electric version will hit the market in 2024.

A fuel cell vehicle has an electric motor just like an electric vehicle, but the motor is powered by electricity produced through hydrogen, enhancing the battery's range.


A 16kW fuel cell will extend the car's range to 800km without recharging, and the battery will be twice as light, resulting in a 75% reduction in carbon footprint compared to a conventional electric model, Renault said.

The Scenic Vision comes as Renault pushes ahead with plans to split its electric vehicle and combustion engine businesses.

A pioneer in electric cars with Japan's Nissan (7201.T) and Mitsubishi (7211.T) at the start of the previous decade, Renault has been eclipsed by pure player Tesla (TSLA.O) and the ambitions of Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE).

Asian carmakers Toyota (7203.T) and Hyundai (005380.KS) already have hydrogen fuel cells cars on the market, while BMW is planning to launch the hydrogen iX5 this year as a small batch series.

157,US agency opens probe into fatal Tesla vehicle crash that killed three,2022-05-19 07:54:44,"
WASHINGTON, May 18 (Reuters) - A U.S. auto safety agency said Wednesday it has opened an investigation into a fatal crash involving a Tesla vehicle in California this month that resulted in three deaths and could have been caused by its advanced driver assistance system.

The crash, involving a 2022 model Tesla Model S that slammed into construction equipment in Newport Beach last week, is one of 35 under investigation by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) involving Tesla vehicles in which advanced driver assistance systems like Autopilot were suspected of being used since 2016.

A total of 14 crash deaths have been reported in those Tesla investigations, including the three recent fatalities.


NHTSA confirmed the new probe of a May 12 Tesla Model S crash that killed three in the vehicle and injured three workers, when it struck construction equipment along the Pacific Coast Highway in Newport Beach.

Newport Beach Police declined to say Wednesday if the Tesla vehicle was in Autopilot mode at the time of the crash, saying it remains under investigation.

Tesla's Autopilot and other driver assistance systems that handle some tasks for drivers have come under increased scrutiny.

Tesla says on its website that Autopilot provides drivers assistance by enabling vehicles to steer, accelerate and brake automatically but ""require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous."" NHTSA notes there are no autonomous vehicles for sale that would allow drivers to not pay attention.

NHTSA sends special crash teams to conduct over 100 extensive special crash investigations annually of ""unique real-world crashes"" to ""perform in-depth clinical investigations in a timely manner that can be used by the automotive safety community to improve the performance of its advanced safety systems.""

Of the 35 special crash investigations by NHTSA into Tesla since 2016 involving advanced driver assistance systems, Autopilot use has been ruled out in three.

NHTSA separately said on Wednesday that in April it had opened another special crash investigation involving a 2016 Tesla Model X in a Florida collision that caused a minor injury, which may have also involved the use of an advanced driver assistance system.

In August, NHTSA said it opened a formal preliminary defect evaluation into Autopilot and has identified at least a dozen crashes involving Tesla models and emergency vehicles. That investigation is still pending.

158,Crypto Exchange FTX Is Pushing Into Stocks But Whos Trading Anything,2022-05-20 12:24:00,"The U.S. arm of cryptocurrency exchange FTX is pushing into stocks, the latest sign that brokerages are gunning for a model that would allow retail investors to trade a more diverse array of assets at a time when volumes have fallen precipitously.

FTX.US has made equity trading available in a testing phase to a group of customers chosen from a wait list, the company said Thursday. Integrated with FTX’s crypto trading platform, FTX Stocks will allow users to buy and sell the likes of Apple (ticker: AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) stock as well as exchange-traded funds and hundreds of other U.S. securities alongside Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Fractional share trading will be allowed for some securities.

“Our goal is to offer a holistic investing service for our customers across all asset classes,” said FTX.US President Brett Harrison in a statement. “We have created a single integrated platform for retail investors to easily trade crypto, NFTs, and traditional stock offerings through a transparent and intuitive user interface.”

FTX.US said it won’t receive payment for order flow—a controversial way that brokers such as Robinhood Markets (HOOD) subsidize free trading by routing orders through third-party trading firms instead of stock exchanges. Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX’s co-founder and chief executive, has taken a 7.6% stake in Robinhood, according to regulatory filings earlier this month.

“There is clear market demand for a new retail investment experience that offers full order routing transparency to customers and does not rely on payment for order flow,” Harrison said.

FTX.US bucks the trend of traditional finance brokerages moving into cryptocurrencies. Robinhood rolled out crypto trading to more than two million users in April, and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is making a similar push into the world of digital assets.

Instead, with FTX, a crypto-native firm is moving into traditional finance.It isn’t the first time: FTX took a stake in IEX Group, the operator of a U.S.-regulated equities exchange, last month.

The convergence of traditional finance and crypto-native firms on trading platforms that allow users to buy and sell both equities and digital assets comes as trading volumes—both in stocks and cryptos—have taken a dive.

Amid the broad selloff in markets in 2022, retail traders seem to be staying put. The S&P 500 has tumbled almost 19% so far this year while the price of Bitcoin has declined closer to 40%.

This has manifested in trouble for brokers. Robinhood has announced plans to cut 9% of its staff amid a slowdown revealed in its quarterly earnings last month. Management reported a 10% fall in monthly active users on an annual basis. Robinhood stock is down 44% this year.

It has been even worse in the crypto world, where leading exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) reported a loss of $1.98 per share in the first quarter, far below the 1-cent loss forecast by Wall Street. Trading volumes at Coinbase plunged to $309 billion in the first quarter of the year, down 8% from the year prior and 44% below levels in the final period of 2021. Coinbase stock has tumbled 73% so far in 2022.

And there are reasons to believe things might get worse for Coinbase—and potentially others in the crypto world—as digital asset prices continue to slide. Coinbase didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Barron’s on whether the company was considering an expansion into stock trading.

Analysts led by Dan Dolev at Mizuho Securities wrote in a note Thursday that they estimated after a survey that the average Bitcoin holder’s cost basis is $21,000; the largest digital asset was changing hands around $30,000 on Thursday.

“If true, this means that the more Bitcoin nears such levels, the closer the average investor gets to the break-even point,” the analysts wrote. “What is the tipping point that could trigger investors to liquidate Bitcoin?” Their survey suggested the figure would be around $9,000.

Broad-based, large-scale Bitcoin sales could see a wave of retail traders leave Coinbase’s platform, hurting the company. But a note of optimism, Dolev noted, was that nearly 50% of those surveyed reported no intention to sell Bitcoin irrespective of how low it goes.

Mizuho rates Coinbase at Neutral with a price target of $60. Late Thursday afternoon, the stock was a bit below $67.

Corrections & Amplifications: FTX took a stake in IEX Group, the operator of an equities exchange, last month. An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified IEX Group as the exchange.

159,Teslas Musk says he can no longer support Democrats will vote Republican,2022-05-19 01:34:55,"
SAN FRANCISCO, May 18 (Reuters) - Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk said on Wednesday that while he voted for Democrats in the past, he will now vote for Republicans.

""In the past I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party. But they have become the party of division & hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican,"" he tweeted.

""Now, watch their dirty tricks campaign against me unfold,"" said Musk, the world's richest man, who has agreed to buy Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).


The 50-year-old billionaire recently said he would reverse Twitter's ban on former U.S. President Donald Trump, a Republican, when he buys the social media platform. He also said Twitter is far-left-biased because it is headquartered in California, a state known for its progressive politics.

Tesla's stock fell 6.8% on Wednesday, after he announced his support for Republicans and Tesla was removed from a closely-watched sustainable index. read more

Tweets mocking Elon as being ""poor Elon"" were trending on social media platform Twitter, sparking his mother Maye Musk to weigh in with her own tweet to defend her son.

""Poor Elon might only be the 2nd or 3rd richest man in the world now,"" one twitter user said.

""Poor Elon. No liberals are going to buy his cars anymore, when there's so many nicer options,"" another said.

Musk's mother criticized some tweets for ""nasty comments"" and alleged they were ""troll or bot"", referring to fake accounts.

Musk has been a vocal critic of the Biden administration and Democrats for their proposals to tax billionaires and give more tax incentives to union-made electric vehicles. Tesla does not have unions at its U.S. factories.

Last year, Tesla, which counts California as its biggest market in the United States, moved its headquarters from California to the more politically conservative Texas.

Musk moved his personal residence from California to Texas, where there is no state income tax. He has sold about $25 billion worth of Tesla stock since last year in order to pay taxes and finance his proposed acquisition of Twitter. Analysts said the sales helped him cash in on Tesla's stock rally and diversify his wealth.

161,Elon Musk Seeks to Reassure Tesla Investors Over Twitter Deal,2022-05-20 10:26:00,"Elon Musk had a message for Twitter and Tesla investors. Fixing the social media company wouldn’t be rocket science.

Musk took to Twitter (ticker: TWTR) Thursday evening, perhaps to reassure Tesla (TSLA) investor about the planned deal, saying that Twitter won’t take up too much of his time. “I’m spending

Musk, of course, knows something about rocket science. He runs SpaceX, the privately held aerospace company that pioneered reusable rockets.

Tesla stock was up 2% in premarket trading Friday. Musk’s post on Twitter might explain part of the move. Tesla investors have been worried about management distraction since Musk’s initial Twitter stake was disclosed in early April. Tesla stock is down about 38% since then. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite are off 15% and 22%, respectively.

“While the Twitter situation in theory does not impact the Tesla fundamental story, the distraction risks for Musk (perception is reality) are hard to ignore,” wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives on Thursday. The Twitter bid comes “at a time that the Tesla ecosystem have never needed Musk more with the worst supply chain crisis seen in modern history.”

Neither Tesla nor SpaceX immediately responded to a request for comment.

The overall market is stronger Friday. That obscures just how much benefit Tesla shares are deriving from Musk’s Twitter. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures are up about 1% and 0.8%, respectively.

Tesla stock is more volatile than the market. It tends to rise faster when things are going well and fall harder when investor fears rise.

Musk told investors, on Twitter, recently that the Twitter purchase was on hold pending his investigation into the issue of spam bots. Twitter believes spam accounts make up about 5% of daily active usage. Musk believes the number is far higher and said as much on a podcast earlier this week.

Investors don’t seem to have a feel for how the Twitter-Musk saga will turn out. Future Fund Active ETF (FFND) co-founder Gary Black ran a poll on Twitter and found that while some 16% of respondent said they would wait and see the survey results, about 10% of active respondents, those who made a call, think the Twitter purchase will happen at the original $54.20 price. Some 40% of active respondents believe a lower price is coming and 50% think Musk will walk away.

Almost 10,000 people voted in the poll. About half think a deal happens. The other half doesn’t. Tesla is the largest position in the Future Fund.

Coming into Friday trading, Tesla stock is off about 33% year to date. The Musk-related drama might be a part of that, but automotive stocks have been hurt by investor fears over inflation and rising interest rates. General Motors (GM) stock, for instance, is down about 38% year to date.

162,NIO Stock Closes Higher in Its Singapore Debut,2022-05-20 10:25:00,"Shares of Chinese electric-vehicle maker NIO closed higher Friday in their first trading day in Singapore, the third exchange on which investors can trade the stock.

NIO (ticker: NIO) stock began trading at $16.90 and rose to as high as $20.29 on the Singapore exchange. Shares closed at $17.30.

U.S.-listed shares of NIO closed Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange at $16.66.

Shares that investors own in New York, Singapore or Hong Kong — the three exchanges on which NIO shares are listed — are all the same. Small price differences might arise from day to day. If an investor could execute the trade, the investor could theoretically arbitrage those differences such as the recent 64-cent difference between New York and Singapore. That gap, excluding transaction costs, could net an arbitrageur a quick 3.8%.

The arbitrage is tough though. NIO stock already was gaining almost 7% to $17.82 in premarket trading in New York. The Singapore trades are probably helping. So is the overall market. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gained about 1% and 0.8%, respectively.

“Today marks a new milestone for NIO. The listing on the SGX is of great importance to NIO’s global business development. NIO has further strengthened its footing in the global capital markets,” said NIO founder William Li in a statement emailed by the company. “By collaborating with science and research institutions and establishing NIO’s R&D center for [artificial intelligence] and [autonomous driving] in Singapore, we will further broaden and enhance our global R&D footprint.”

Another reason NIO is listing on multiple exchanges is the threat of delisting in the U.S. Foreign companies listed on American stock exchanges have to comply with U.S. auditing oversight standards. Foreign accounting firms — the ones that check foreign companies’ books — have to be auditable by U.S. authorities under recently passed law.

NIO, along with many other U.S.-listed Chinese companies, don’t meet that requirement yet. If nothing changes in coming years, that means NIO stock might be forced to leave the NYSE.

The delisting threat is one reason NIO shares have fallen in 2022. Coming into Friday, NIO’s U.S.-listed stock has fallen 47% this year, far worse than the 18% and 14% declines of the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, respectively.

Delisting isn’t the only reason for stock weakness. Most automotive stocks are down more than the market so far in 2022 as investors worry that inflation will cool demand for new cars while raising production costs. Tesla (TSLA) and General Motors (GM) shares, for instance, have dropped about 32% and 38%, respectively.

Summary Companies Target Corp loses quarter of value as profit slumps

Megacap growth stocks drag down S&P 500, Nasdaq

Indexes end: S&P 500 -4.04%, Nasdaq -4.73%, Dow -3.57%

May 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Wednesday, with Target losing around a quarter of its stock market value and highlighting worries about the U.S. economy after the retailer became the latest victim of surging prices.

It was the worst one-day loss for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average since June 2020.

Target Corp's (TGT.N) first-quarter profit fell by half and the company warned of a bigger margin hit on rising fuel and freight costs. Its shares fell about 25%, losing about $25 billion in market capitalization, in their worst session since the Black Monday crash on Oct. 19, 1987. read more

""Retailers are starting to reveal the impact of eroding consumer purchasing power.""

Interest-rate sensitive megacap growth stocks added to recent declines and pulled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lower. Amazon (AMZN.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) dropped close to 7%, while Apple (AAPL.O) fell 5.6%.

""The cons outweigh the pros for growth stocks at this particular moment, and the market is trying to decide how bad it's going to get,"" said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. ""The market is fearful of the next six months. We may find out that it doesn't need to be as fearful as this, and markets do tend to overreact on the downside.""

All of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and consumer staples (.SPLRCS) leading the way lower, both down more than 6%.

Rising inflation, the conflict in Ukraine, prolonged supply chain snarls, pandemic-related lockdowns in China and monetary policy tightening by central banks have weighed on financial markets recently, stoking concerns about a global economic slowdown.

Wall Street's recent sell-off has left the S&P 500 trading at around 17 times expected earnings, its lowest PE valuation since the 2020 sell-off caused by the coronavirus pandemic, according to Refinitiv data.

S&P 500's forward PE dips below 10-year average

The CBOE volatility index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, rose to 31 points after falling for six straight sessions.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was 12.5 billion shares, compared with a 13.4 billion average over the last 20 trading days.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.52-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 37 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 242 new lows.

164,Tesla Loses Top Spot in Cathie Woods Flagship Fund Roku Is the New No 1,2022-05-20 10:15:00,"ARK Invest founder Cathie Wood is a long-time Tesla bull. Her 2026 price target for the electric-vehicle maker’s shares is $4,600. Tesla, though, isn’t the largest holding in ARK Innovation ETF anymore.

That distinction now goes to video streaming streaming service provider Roku (ticker: ROKU). It accounts for about 8.4% of ARK Innovation’s holdings. Tesla (TSLA) accounts for about 8.2% of the fund.

The rest of the top five holdings are: Zoom Video Communications (ZM) at 7.9%, Exact Sciences (EXAS) at 5.9% and Block (SQ) at 5.7%.

Tesla doesn’t seem to have lost its top spot as part of an explicit trading strategy. Recent stock market performance has changed the relative rankings. Coming into Friday trading, Tesla stock has dropped 27% over the past month. Roku has declined only 12%.

Tesla stock has been battered by the tech selloff. CEO Elon Musk’s potential purchase of Twitter (TWTR) also has become an overhang on the shares. Tesla stock is down about 38% since Musk’s initial Twitter stake was disclosed. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite have fallan about 15% and 22% over the same span.

Investors appear to be worried about how much Musk has on his plate. He runs Tesla, SpaceX, The Boring Company and Neuralink. Musk took to Twitter on Friday to reassure Tesla shareholders than Twitter was only taking about 5% of his time and Tesla was on his mind 24/7.

The decline in Tesla stock, along with other high-growth names, has hurt Wood’s fund. ARK Innovation is down about 23% over the past month and about 55% year to date.

Investors have shunned the highest growth, more speculative stocks as interest rates have risen. High-growth companies generate most of their earnings far in the future and higher interest rates make those earnings worth less when discounted back to today. That’s one reason why rising rates tend to hurt richly valued stocks more than others.

Tesla stock was is up about 2.3% in premarket trading on Friday. Roku shares have gained about 2.5%. S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose up about 1.1% and 0.9%, respectively.

166,Its crunch time for the push to ban Congress from trading stocks,2022-05-20 09:11:00,"A China competition bill, additional Ukraine aid, further COVID-19 funding, addressing inflation and more.

U.S. lawmakers face a big to-do list before they take their August recess and then focus primarily on November’s midterm elections, but advocates for a ban on congressional trading of individual stocks sound upbeat about lawmakers managing to deliver on that issue.

“I think there’s great momentum. It’s just not public,” said Donald Sherman, senior vice president and chief counsel for the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a watchdog group.

“My understanding is that there’s a Senate compromise bill that is going to be released relatively soon. That is a compromise insofar as it combined elements from lots of people’s bills.”

Sherman said by “soon” he means “by this time next month.”

The CREW expert also pointed to some progress in the House of Representatives, following the House Administration Committee’s April 7 hearing on possible new limits on the buying and selling of individual stocks by lawmakers. Sherman said he received “pretty robust” additional questions from that panel earlier this week after testifying at that hearing — “which suggests to me that members are in the weeds on what comprehensive legislation might look like.”

“I would think that the Senate would aim to get something across the finish line before August recess, so that then the House can resolve and pass something in the fall,” Sherman added.

“This is an issue that members of Congress are either going to run on — or run from — in November. And so I think that timeline makes sense, in order to ensure that members can go back to their districts in the fall and demonstrate that they have gotten this across the finish line.”

Around 63% of all voters favor a ban on stock trading for lawmakers, with support at 69% among Democrats and 58% among Republicans, according to a recent Morning Consult/Politico poll. But the issue doesn’t rank as urgent, as Americans are focused on inflation, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, immigration, climate change and election laws, according to a Quinnipiac University survey.

The raft of bipartisan bills aiming to stop congressional trading in individual stocks has been driven in part by reports about lawmakers who bought and sold stocks in the COVID-19 pandemic’s early days after they were privy to warnings — along with news that many lawmakers have been late with their disclosures. Other reports have raised additional questions, including a MarketWatch article in January that revealed how Congress resembled a Wall Street trading desk last year, with lawmakers and their family members making an estimated total of $355 million worth of stock trades as the market SPX, -0.75% DJIA, -0.62% soared.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat, told reporters last week that he hopes to have stock-trading legislation to vote on “this year.”

“That’s a sign that there still is some momentum there, but there’s not a desire to commit to a particular timeline,” said Jennifer Schulp, an expert from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

“I view this as one that could pretty quickly shift,” she added, meaning the timing for a vote “could very easily turn into June or July, if it if it turns into a priority.”

Schulp, the director of financial regulation studies at the Cato’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said she doesn’t support a ban on congressional trading of individual stocks, saying it wouldn’t restore trust in Congress or address other conflicts of interests.

She favors measures that would increase transparency, such as cutting the amount of time allowed between a trade and the required disclosure, or raising the penalties for not filing disclosures correctly. She also was a witness at the April 7 hearing.

While Congress is busy trying to tackle inflation, a baby-formula shortage and other matters, the push for a stock-trading ban is “not in contention with those other issues,” said Liz Hempowicz, director of public policy at the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), a watchdog that has lobbied for a ban that would cover lawmakers, their spouses and dependents.

“I think it’s all related, and the public needs to know that Congress can approach those kitchen-table issues with clear eyes and with the public interest at the front and center,” Hempowicz said. The alternative is Americans end up concerned about lawmakers handling a matter “with their own pocketbook in mind,” she said.

Public sentiment in favor of a ban helps make her “cautiously optimistic” on achieving it, added Hempowicz, who was among the witnesses on April 7 as well.

“Things are moving. It’s just behind the scenes,” she said.

Critics of a ban say it would discourage people from running for office, or it would be difficult to implement, especially with blind trusts being considered. Another argument is that U.S. lawmakers should understand what it’s like to invest in stocks given that they decide policy about the equity market.

Rep. Spanberger’s take, President Biden’s role

One House lawmaker who has co-sponsored one of the bills that would end congressional trading in individual stocks sounded somewhat discouraged in an interview this week, even as she seemed excited by Schumer’s comment about a Senate vote in 2022.

“Hopefully we’ll see them lead by example — faster than we might see action in the House, which is sad to me since we’re supposed to be the people’s House,” said Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, referring to the Senate.

“But if that’s the reality, then I look forward to them doing the right thing, and then ideally, hopefully, the House will follow suit.”

The Senate is dealing with “too many competing ideas,” but the problem in the House “is not coalescing around legislation,” she said. “The issue is House leadership doesn’t want to move this. That’s the problem in the House.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat, defended stock trading by lawmakers and their spouses in December, but then in January reversed herself to some extent, asking the House Administration Committee to look into a possible ban on congressional trading and saying: “I just don’t buy into that. But if members want to do that, I’m OK with that.”

Pelosi ranked as the eighth-biggest trader last year among Congress’s more than 500 members, with $12 million in buys and no sells. That’s according to MarketWatch’s January report, which used a Capitol Trades analysis of disclosures filed by members of Congress for their trading activity or for their family members’ buys and sells.

Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia speaks on banning stock trades for members of Congress at a news conference on April 7. She’s joined by (L-R) Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO). Getty Images

When asked what she’s doing to win over Pelosi, Spanberger said: “Getting more co-sponsors.” Her bill, introduced with Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, has attracted more than 60 co-sponsors — “quite a lot of co-sponsors for a bill that’s not imminently coming for a vote,” she said.

The Virginia Democrat decried seeing fellow lawmakers buy shares in pharmaceutical or cleaning-supply companies during the onset of the COVID pandemic, as well as buying stock in a defense company that’s “going to be producing massive amounts of specific weaponry for a war in Ukraine that we knew was coming.”

“The fact that there are members of Congress who think they’re ‘right’ to be able to buy stocks, which equates to profiting off that information, is to me just unconscionable,” Spanberger said.

“I’m continuing to build up a coalition of people who believe that this reform is necessary. But I can’t change everybody’s minds. And sadly there’s numbers behind why some people might not be inclined to support it.”

An additional hurdle could be the 50-50 Senate’s filibuster rule, in which 60 votes are required to end debate on most items, so the minority party is able to stymie the majority’s efforts. But some Republican senators have backed bills focused on congressional trading, including Tennessee’s Marsha Blackburn, Montana’s Steve Daines, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham and Missouri’s Josh Hawley.

Another watchdog group that’s pushing for a ban is planning to get President Joe Biden involved, hoping that could spark action.

“We will send a letter requesting that he push this through and basically follow his campaign promise to push for laws where Congress is not influenced by their personal financial holdings,” said Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics and general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center (CLC). That refers to a Biden campaign pledge to work with Congress to enact laws that would stop lawmakers from being influenced by those holdings.

That letter, with signatures from a range of groups, is likely to go out this week or next week, according to Payne.

The CLC expert ties passage of 2012’s STOCK Act to a strong nudge from then-President Barack Obama during a State of the Union address. That law requires disclosures of stock trades by lawmakers, and it aims to help prevent politicians from insider trading, but it’s viewed as insufficient by some watchdog groups.

“It was recognized” a decade ago that the president could deliver “a push from outside of the legislature, and that’s what needs to happen now,” Payne said.

“This problem of perceived conflicts of interest with stock trading is not going away, and it will get worse unless Congress acts right away,” he added.

167,Opinion Elon Musks autonomous vehicle forecasts are not just too optimistic  theyre wrong,2022-05-20 08:50:00,"Elon Musk recently told a Financial Times conference: “I think we are actually quite close to achieving self driving at a safety level that is better than human.” By “self-driving,” he meant “autonomy,” and his “best guess” is that “we’ll get there this year.”

Autonomy is supposed to make rides in Tesla’s TSLA, -8.41% planned robotaxis affordable and safe. Musk predicted that his company “will get far in excess of the safety level of human … ultimately probably a factor of 10 safer than a human as measured by the probability of injury.”

Don’t bet on it.

If yet another Musk prediction proves too optimistic, no one will be surprised – least of all Musk. But the problem here is not excessive optimism about the pace of improvement. So-called “autonomous vehicles” are not just taking longer to develop than expected. They are a dead end.

Skeptics about AVs have a decade of failed promises to point to. AV proponents’ reply is that the forecasts were just too optimistic about the pace toward the destination. The rate of progress may be disappointing, they admit – but we’ll get there.

But we have far more than a decade of experience to learn from, and this experience reveals persistent biases that inflate expectations.

We have been promised that engineering will nearly eliminate motor vehicle crashes for 90 years. In 1934, the leading American expert in the field, Miller McClintock, promised that state-of-the-art highways can be “built in such a way that accidents will be impossible.” With access controls, grade separations, median strips, and shoulders, he wrote, “foolproof highways” are possible. McClintock estimated that such roads would reduce fatalities by 98% – enough to justify a promise of “complete permanent safety.” In the press, McClintock’s claims were widely accepted as fact. In 1937 the Chicago Tribune made “deathproof highways” the No. 1 plank in its editorial platform.

Limited-access highways are much safer than other roads, but nowhere near as safe as McClintock promised. Had he been right, the death toll today would be too small to give AV promoters their favorite moral argument.

Musk is promising to achieve the dramatic gains through incalculably more sophisticated technology – tech that takes over entirely from the human driver. This obvious fact, however, obscures the same elementary error in both forecasts, and in many others over the interceding decades. To arrive at their conclusions, the promise makers subtract all the hazards that make the status quo dangerous – without adding in all the major new hazards that the innovation introduces.

On limited-access highways, most of the new hazards were due the speeds that such roads invite. If no driver exceeded 20 mph, deaths on them would indeed fall to near zero. But highways justify their cost by permitting much faster driving – at speeds that can be deadly. Similarly, the technology in AVs can make them much safer, but the faster the vehicle travels, the less the tech can do.

Sensors may sense almost instantaneously, but like humans, AVs can need time to interpret unusual objects with high reliability, and they must track moving objects over time to predict how they are likely to behave. At low speeds, such problems are manageable. A slow AV has time to interpret, track, predict and respond – and if it still fails, a low-speed collision may be minor. But to attract paying riders in large numbers, AVs would have to offer speed. And at speed, AVs’ errors will be far more frequent and much more lethal.

The comparison with “foolproof highways” has more to offer. People who drive on limited-access highways have to drive on ordinary roads and streets to get to and from them. The roads’ safety benefit cannot extend everywhere, and safer highways can increase the casualties on the roads around them just by attracting more driving.

Island Press

Similarly, there is no direct path toward an unmixed AV future in which all vehicles on the roads are automated. There must be many years of mixed AVs and conventional vehicles. Conventional cars can be connected to a network, making them easier for AVs to monitor, but mixed traffic will remain so difficult that AVs will have to be either hazardous or slow.

If AVs are slow, this will prolong the transition (why ride in a slow AV?) and introduce new safety hazards as frustrated human drivers try to pass slow AVs.

Finally, AVs will continue to disappoint because they are misnamed in a way that inflates what we expect of them. “Autonomous” predisposes people to think of AVs as unbiased hyperrational beings with a “self” that can drive, and enough discretion to exercise autonomy. The misperception is apparent in Musk’s choice of words: “self-driving … that is better than human.” In developing an AV, engineers’ goal is to ensure that everything the vehicle does is what its human developers and operators want it to do. Unpredictable behavior by the vehicle must be extirpated. The goal in AV development is to ensure that humans so thoroughly determine how the vehicle performs that the vehicle itself can have zero autonomy.

AVs are in fact human-driven vehicles, though the operators are not in the vehicle, and they control it through programs rather than through a direct physical interface. These human operators must be biased – otherwise they will have no paying human customers. Except in niche applications or in services operated at a loss (such as Alphabet’s GOOG, -2.26% GOOGL, -2.30% Waymo, and perhaps Tesla’s eventual robotaxis), they must not value safety so much that the vehicle never exceeds 20 mph. They must also value the customer’s experience more than they value the preferences of others outside the vehicle—if they don’t, they will lose their customers.

These human biases are business imperatives, and they come at a cost to safety that precludes the kind of safety gains that Musk and other AV promoters have predicted. AVs cannot become common until they can earn more revenue than they cost. And they can’t do that and prioritize safety over customer satisfaction.

AV promoters have not been too optimistic about AVs’ pace of development. They have been wrong about what AVs have to offer.

168,SP Dumps Tesla From Its ESG Index Why Sustainable Ratings Are a Problem,2022-05-20 08:31:00,"S&P Dow Jones Indices’ decision this week to boot Tesla from the S&P 500 ESG Index has cast a harsh light on the role that environmental, social, and governance, or ESG ratings play in scoring companies as positive for the planet.

Investment firms use ESG ratings from companies such as MSCI (MSCI), the largest ESG rating company, and Sustainalytics, owned by Morningstar (MORN), as a guide in screening stocks for inclusion in ESG and sustainable investment portfolios and funds.

ESG ratings have been under fire this year since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Some critics have questioned why ESG-labeled funds owned companies such as Russia’s state-backed energy giant, Gazprom (GAZP).

This week, S&P Global’s (SPGI) S&P Dow Jones Indices division said that Tesla (TSLA), which CEO Elon Musk says he founded to put the world on a path to a sustainable-energy future, doesn’t have a comprehensive low-carbon strategy and no longer qualifies for inclusion in the S&P 500 ESG Index (SPXESUP).

Tesla was “ineligible for index inclusion due to its low S&P DJI ESG Score,” Margaret Dorn, head of ESG Indices, North America, at S&P Dow Jones Indices, wrote in a blog post explaining the decision. “So, while Tesla’s S&P DJI ESG Score has remained fairly stable year-over-year, it was pushed further down the ranks relative to its global industry group peers.”

John Streur, president and CEO of Calvert Research and Management and president of the Calvert funds, says there is “nothing about what we heard from S&P that would change our mind about Tesla.”

Calvert, a pioneer and leader in responsible investing since 1982, with $37.2 billion under management as of March 30, owns Tesla stock in several of its indexes and funds, including the Calvert U.S. Large-Cap Core Responsible Index Fund (CISIX) and Calvert Global Energy Solutions Fund (CAEIX).

“We look at Tesla and we see what an important impact they have had in an important sector in terms of reining in climate change, reining in carbon emissions,” Streur says. “We’re holding the [stock] in the context of a company with enormously ambitious plans, that is rapidly scaling on a global basis. And we are pushing them and engaging with them to continuously improve how they treat their employees and their environmental sustainability.”

Aniket Shah, global head of ESG and sustainable finance strategy at Jefferies, says the ESG community should consider S&P’s decision to remove Tesla from the index “a true indictment” of ESG ratings.

“ESG ratings aren’t a helpful way to do ESG analysis,” says Shah. “It is not possible, nor is it worthwhile, to try to boil down the complexities of ESG issues to a single score or a single letter.”

An S&P Dow Jones Indices spokesperson referred Barron’s to the company’s blog post but declined to comment further.

Those who expect ESG ratings to be a reflection of a company’s planetary impact are going to be “sorely disappointed”, says Ken Pucker, a senior lecturer at The Fletcher School at Tufts University. “The problem is that many people think an ESG rating says something about a company’s social sustainability or planetary impact, when that isn’t what it is,” he says. “The fact that Tesla gets rated either high or low on ESG says nothing about Tesla’s transformational impact on the auto market.”

With many firms offering ESG scores, it can be challenging for investors to differentiate among them. For example, Sustainalytics assigns Tesla a rating of 28.5, which indicates the company has medium risk, according to Sustainalytics’ ESG Risk Rating scoring system. Sustainalytics’ system measures a company’s exposure to, and management of material ESG risks.

Sustainalytics also evaluates the company using “impact metrics,” such as human development and resource scarcity, that are based on the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

According to MSCI’s ESG Ratings and Climate Search Tool, Tesla has an “A” rating, and is considered average among 41 companies in the automobiles industry.

It has been a tough year for ESG fund sponsors and investors due to lagging performance and declining investment flows into ESG investing strategies. ESG ratings firms have also faced tough questions over Russia.

In April, the state of Utah wrote a letter objecting to S&P Global Ratings publishing ESG credit indicators as part of its credit ratings for states and state subdivisions. “S&P gave Russian-controlled energy producers higher ESG ratings than similar entities in the U.S. Russian energy giants Gazprom and Rosneft outscored American energy companies Exxon Mobil and Chevron on S&P’s ESG scale,” it stated.

Amber Fairbanks, portfolio manager at Mirova, the sustainable investing affiliate of Natixis Investment Managers, says she understands how people can be critical of ESG after seeing the news about Tesla, as “it just doesn’t make a lot of sense.”

While Tesla was cut from the index, Exxon Mobil (XOM) was added this year, raising some eyebrows.

“We’ve always seen some problems with third-party rating agencies, particularly their reliance on disclosure,” says Fairbanks. “It’s why a company such as Exxon Mobil is rated quite highly. They have a tremendous amount of disclosure around sustainability.”

Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at the Stern School of Business at New York University, has a different view regarding Exxon Mobil’s inclusion. “The good news is that fossil-fuel companies aren’t destined to always be viewed as bad companies, no matter what they do,” he says.

169,Elon Musk denies that SpaceX paid 250000 to settle sexualmisconduct claim against him,2022-05-20 08:03:00,"SpaceX paid a flight attendant $250,000 in 2018 to settle a sexual-misconduct claim against Elon Musk, its founder and chief executive, according to a report Thursday by Business Insider. Musk denied what he called the “wild accusations.”

Citing interviews with a friend of the woman and documents it obtained, Business Insider reported the woman accused Musk of exposing himself to her on a flight to London, rubbed her leg without her consent and offered to buy her a horse in exchange for an erotic massage.

Late Thursday night, Musk called the allegations “utterly untrue.”

The incident reportedly happened in 2016 during an in-flight, full-body massage for Musk, a practice apparently not unusual for the company’s executives.

The flight attendant refused his proposition, Business Insider reported, and filed a complaint with SpaceX’s human-resources department in 2018, claiming that her career opportunities had been hurt by her refusal and that she was being retaliated against.

SpaceX took the issue to a mediator, and the woman signed a $250,000 severance agreement that included a promise not to sue nor to ever discuss the settlement or any information about Musk or his businesses, according to the report.

When asked for comment, Musk — the world’s wealthiest individual, who’s also the CEO of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -8.44% and is engaged in the tortuous process of ostensibly acquiring Twitter Inc. TWTR, +1.60% — reportedly told Business Insider that there was “a lot more to the story” and called it a “politically motivated hit piece.”

Opinion: Elon Musk doesn’t want to buy Twitter anymore, but Twitter can squeeze $1 billion — or more — out of him anyway

“If I were inclined to engage in sexual harassment, this is unlikely to be the first time in my entire 30-year career that it comes to light,” Musk reportedly wrote.

Tesla’s stock bounced 1.9% in premarket trading Friday, after closing Thursday at a nine-month low. The stock has tumbled 32.9% to date in 2022, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.75% has shed 18.2%.

The publication’s request for comment may have been the impetus for Musk to tweet on Wednesday that “Political attacks on me will escalate dramatically in coming months,” and he claimed Democrats, with whom he said he formerly aligned for ”kindness” reasons, were behind a “dirty tricks campaign against me.”

Late Thursday night, Musk tweeted: “The attacks against me should be viewed through a political lens – this is their standard (despicable) playbook – but nothing will deter me from fighting for a good future and your right to free speech.”

He later added, in another tweet: “And, for the record, those wild accusations are utterly untrue.”

While there have been a number of sexual-harassment and misconduct complaints concerning the office cultures at both SpaceX and Tesla, Musk himself has not been the subject of any publicly disclosed misconduct claims before.

170,Apple and Microsoft Stocks Rise as Rough Week for Big Tech Ends,2022-05-20 07:33:00,"Megacap technology companies Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta traded higher on Friday, recovering some of their recent losses.

The companies had seen big selloffs as market sentiment soured over the past few weeks. Faster inflation, a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike and strict Covid lockdowns in China conspired to bring the tech-heavy Nasdaq index of higher-risk stocks into a bear market. The benchmark Nasdaq 100 has lost more than $1 trillion of market value this month.

News that China on Friday unexpectedly lowered a key interest rate that is used as a benchmark for mortgages lifted stocks worldwide. The move raises hopes that the economic slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy won’t be as bad as feared.

Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.6% in premarket trading Friday, though the index remains 15% lower than it was a year ago. Apple (ticker: AAPL), the world’s most valuable company until it was overtaken by Saudi Aramco (2222.SA) a few months ago, climbed 1.4%.

Microsoft (MSFT) was up 1.7%, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) traded up 1.2%, electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) gained 2.3%, and Meta (FB), the parent company of Facebook, rose 1.4% in the pre-market.

171,Massive paydays for tech CEOs could face investors wrath,2022-05-20 07:18:00,"Shareholders in some of the world’s biggest tech companies will vote next week on top executives’ compensation, as influential advisory services urge them to fight the massive paydays.

“Say on pay” votes are scheduled for Wednesday at Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.17% , Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. FB, +0.75% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, +1.64% , as part of those companies’ annual shareholder meetings. The votes are advisory and nonbinding, but they give investors a chance to make their feelings known about the pay of executives at some of the world’s most famous tech companies, which they have already done this proxy season.

About 66% of Intel Corp. INTC, -1.87% shareholders voted against the chip maker’s executive pay structure last week, including compensation of $178 million for Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Investors in other tech companies seeking to speak out against hefty executive compensation have backing from shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services, or ISS, and Glass Lewis, which are both urging Amazon investors to vote against the company’s executive-compensation program, saying executive pay is not aligned with performance.

New Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy, who was promoted last year after company founder Jeff Bezos stepped aside as CEO, was awarded an equity grant worth $214 million. Jassy’s stock grant vests over 10 years, starting in 2023, but ISS noted in its proxy paper that the company’s compensation program is entirely time-based, does not have preset performance criteria, and that it is unclear whether Jassy will continue to receive additional equity awards during the next decade.

“Shareholders should be concerned with this year’s disconnect between pay and performance driven by one-off awards in 2021, including a $214 million mega-grant to the new CEO,” Glass Lewis wrote in its proxy research report.

The advisory firms also expressed their concern over equity awards to two other Amazon executives, CEO of Worldwide Consumer David Clark (nearly $57 million) and CEO of Amazon Web Services Adam Selipsky (nearly $82 million).

In its proxy, Amazon said it has explained to investors its philosophy of tying executive pay to long-term performance. The company said “a small minority of investors” disagree with its approach.

ISS is also recommending that investors vote against the executive compensation program of Facebook’s parent company, saying that Meta appears to determine compensation at the discretion of the board committee; that its incentive programs lack disclosed objective metrics and quantified goals; and that other named executive officers “receive very large equity awards that lack performance vesting criteria.”

ISS further states that the security costs for the company’s top two executives, CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($25.3 million in 2020; $26.8 million in 2021) and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg ($8.5 million in 2020; $11.3 million in 2021), are “exceedingly large” and continue to rise. Zuckerberg had $1 in salary in 2021 and the only other listed compensation for him was security costs, which included a $10 million pretax allowance for personal security that he can use as he sees fit as well as $15.2 million in security costs to the company. Sandberg’s 2021 compensation was $35.3 million, which included a nearly $1 million salary, $850,000 bonus and $22.2 million in stock awards.

In its proxy, Meta said its practices are centered on pay for performance. The company also said the security costs for its top executives are necessary because of their high profiles, and that travel costs for both Zuckerberg and Sandberg were higher in 2021 because of their increased personal travel and a rise in security-personnel costs.

ISS and Glass Lewis also are recommending that investors vote against the executive compensation program at Twitter — although the company does have a pending deal to be taken private by Tesla Inc. TSLA, -8.38% CEO Elon Musk that could render moot any shareholder votes or actions at the meeting.

The advisory firms both expressed concern about a one-time $12.5 million grant awarded to new Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, who took the helm in November, replacing Jack Dorsey. ISS noted that the equity grant is time-based and not performance-based.

In addition, both firms mentioned that Agrawal was awarded another grant for $12.5 million that appears to be incentive-based, along with a $1 million annual salary. Glass Lewis said in its proxy paper that though it recognized that the disconnect between pay and performance can be affected by a CEO transition, “given the value of the awards granted and their impact on total granted compensation for 2021, we remain concerned by the company’s pay practices.”

Equilar estimated that Agrawal would receive $42 million if he is terminated within a year of a change of control of Twitter.

In its proxy, Twitter touted executive-compensation programs “designed to tie award outcomes to the achievement of financial and performance outcomes, as well as returns to our stockholders.”

Investors are voting against pay packages beyond the tech sector as well. Only 31% of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s JPM, -1.66% investors voted for that company’s executive-compensation program this week, according to a transcript of its annual meeting. CEO Jamie Dimon’s total compensation for 2021 was $84.4 million, which included a $52.6 million options award that was framed as a “retention bonus.”

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that, according to Equilar, so far this proxy season 23 companies in the S&P 500 have seen less than 70% support for their executive-compensation programs.

Dieter Waizenegger is executive director of SOC Investment Group, which among other things aims to hold corporations accountable for excessive pay for executives. He said SOC advocates a move away from performance-based incentives, “which can be too easily gamed, and instead return to a full-value time-vesting awards model.” He also said compensation-committee members on corporate boards should be held accountable “when it is clear the board is supporting unjustified executive pay packages.”

172,The technician who called the 2020 market bottom says a shocking rally is in store,2022-05-20 07:08:00,"It’s been a terrible week in an awful year for the stock market.

Walmart WMT, -0.00 , Target TGT, +1.32% , and Tencent 700, +3.53% each reported disappointing results to add fuel to the worries about interest-rate hikes and quantitative tightening. But, Melvin Capital aside, there haven’t been signs of capitulation.

Over the last six weeks, equity redemptions have totaled $46 billion, versus $91 billion when the COVID outbreak first became apparent, according to Sean Darby, chief equity strategist at Jefferies. So you could see the argument on why markets may not have plumbed their depths.

Noted technician Tom DeMark, who called the bottom in 2020 after COVID emerged, disagrees. The founder of DeMark Analytics — known for advising hedge fund managers like Paul Tudor Jones and Steven Cohen — told Fundstrat’s head of technical strategy Mark Newton that key markets are on the verge of reversing.

DeMark’s indicators are designed for anticipating turning points, to find overextended price moves, in either direction, that reverse.

The S&P 500 SPX, -0.72% , DeMark says, will see one more sell-off, with a close below 3,863, before a “shocking rally” lifts the index between 4,400 and 4,500. The 10-year TMUBMUSD10Y, 2.785% will make one more high before peaking, and crude oil CL.1, +0.44% will make a top within four trading days — $117.29 per barrel, he forecasts — before turning lower.

The fundamental implications, if he’s correct, would be that the inflationary drivers of energy and commodities are peaking, which would put less pressure on inflation.

The buzz

Friday’s session features the expiration of key options contracts that could add volatility.

The People’s Bank of China lowered the rate that is used for home mortgages in the country to 4.45% from 4.6%.

Ross Stores ROST, -22.78% joined the retail Armageddon by reporting a 7% drop in same-store sales. Besides flagging sales, the retailer also pointed out the impact of higher transportation and labor costs.

Chip-equipment maker Applied Materials AMAT, -4.89% reported a worse than forecast profit and gave a disappointing outlook. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks PANW, +8.46% however hiked guidance for a third time.

SpaceX paid $250,000 to settle a sexual misconduct claim against its chief executive, Elon Musk, according to a report in Business Insider. Musk, also the chief executive of Tesla TSLA, -8.36% and bidder for Twitter TWTR, +1.64% , told the publication the story was a hit piece, and later tweeted that the accusations are untrue.

173,The billionaires are bleeding Elon Musk Jeff Bezos and other top earners have lost nearly 200 billion in 2022,2022-05-19 10:18:00,"Get the hankies ready.

The world’s top billionaires lost more than $40 billion as markets cratered on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire’s Index, a daily ranking of the world’s wealthiest.

Still at the top of that list is Tesla’s TSLA, -8.38% chief executive officer, Elon Musk, who lost the most of 500 billionaires. Musk shed $12.3 billion of his personal fortune as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.59% and S&P 500 SPX, -0.71% saw their worst days in two years.

Musk has been pursuing a $44 billion deal for Twitter TWTR, +1.64% , arguing with the social-network service’s CEO Parag Agrawal about spam bots, in what may be a bid to get a cheaper deal or walk away from it all together. Wednesday’s batch of Musk tweets, in which he vowed to vote Republican in the next election and decried the S&P ESG index as a scam after the index dumped Tesla, drew wide attention.

Tesla’s stock-price target was slashed by Wedbush on Thursday, as the analyst citing a “circus show” over Twitter and headwinds from China’s COVID battle. Since the deal was announced on April 25, Tesla has dropped 28%, though that has come amid hefty marketwide losses this year with the S&P 500 flirting with a formal bear market.

Dry those crocodile tears, though, as Musk is still worth $210 billion, even if he’s lost $60.4 billion so far this year.

Just behind Musk is Amazon.com AMZN, -0.17% founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos, whose Wednesday losses came in at close second, with a $8.48 billion drop leaving his fortune at $131 billion. Amazon shares have fallen 35% so far this year, taking a hit from last month’s first reported quarterly loss in seven years. On a year-to-date basis, Bezos has lost $61.6 billion.

No. 3 on the ultrawealth list, Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of French luxury-goods giant LVMH Moët Hennessy LVMH, -2.75% , lost $3.15 billion on Wednesday and has seen his fortune dwindle by $52 billion this year, to $126 billion.

174,Bear market beckons as US stock slide deepens,2022-05-20 18:55:41,"
NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The stock market's brutal year neared a grim milestone as the S&P 500's slide on Friday threatened to leave it in a bear market for the first time since March 2020, fueled by worries over sky high inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve and future economic growth.

The benchmark S&P 500 index fell below 3837.248, a decline that on an intraday basis put it 20% from its Jan. 3 record closing high. Should that hold until Friday's close, it would confirm that the index is in a bear market – frequently defined as a drop of at least 20% from a closing high.

If history is any guide, a bear market would mean more pain could be in store for investors. The S&P 500 has fallen by an average of 32.7% in 13 bear markets since 1946, including a nearly 57% drop during the 2007-2009 bear market during the financial crisis, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.


It has taken a little over a year on average for the index to reach its bottom during bear markets, and then roughly another two years to return to its prior high, according to CFRA. Of the 13 bear markets since 1946, the return to breakeven levels has varied, taking as little as three months to as long as 69 months.

The S&P 500 surged some 114% from its March 2020 low as stocks benefited from emergency policies put in place to help stabilize the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

That decline went into reverse at the start of 2022 as the Fed grew far more hawkish and signaled it would tighten monetary policy at a faster-than-expected clip to fight surging inflation. It has already raised rates by 75 basis points this year and expectations of more hikes ahead have weighed on stocks and bonds.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has vowed to raise rates as high as needed to kill inflation but also believes policymakers can guide the economy to a so-called soft landing. read more

Adding to the volatility has been the war in Ukraine, which has caused a further spike in oil and other commodity prices.

for bear market story

A few areas of the stock market have been spared. Energy shares have soared this year, along with oil prices, while defensive groups such as utilities have held up better than broader markets.

On the flip side, shares of technology and other high-growth companies have been hit hard. Those stocks -- high fliers during much of the bull market over the past decade -- are particularly sensitive to higher yields, which dull the allure of companies whose cash flows are weighted more in the future and diminished when discounted at higher rates.

Some of the biggest of these companies, such as Tesla (TSLA.O) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O), are also heavily weighted in the S&P 500 index.

Investors have looked at various metrics to determine when markets will turn higher, including the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street’s fear gauge. While the index is elevated compared to its long-term median, it is still below levels reached in previous major selloffs. read more

175,EXCLUSIVE TikTok plans big push into gaming conducting tests in Vietnam sources,2022-05-19 22:59:53,"
HONG KONG/HANOI, May 19 (Reuters) - TikTok has been conducting tests so users can play games on its video-sharing app in Vietnam, part of plans for a major push into gaming, four people familiar with the matter said.

Featuring games on its platform would boost advertising revenue as well as the amount of time users spend on the app - one of the world's most popular with more than 1 billion monthly active users.

Boasting a tech-savvy population with 70% of its citizens under the age of 35, Vietnam is an attractive market for social media platforms such as TikTok, Meta Platforms Inc's (FB.O) Facebook and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) YouTube and Google.


TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, also plans to roll out gaming more widely in Southeast Asia, the people said. That move could come as early as the third quarter, said two of them.

The sources declined to be identified as the information has yet to be publicly disclosed.

A TikTok representative said the company has tested bringing HTML5 games, a common form of minigame, to its app through tie-ups with third-party game developers and studios such as Zynga Inc (ZNGA.O). But it declined to comment on its plans for Vietnam or its broader gaming ambitions.

""We're always looking at ways to enrich our platform and regularly test new features and integrations that bring value to our community,"" the representative said in an emailed statement to Reuters.

ByteDance did not respond to a request for comment.

Reuters was not able to learn TikTok's plans for rolling out gaming features in other markets. Although TikTok users can watch games being streamed, in most regions they are not able to play games within the TikTok app.

In the United States, only a few games appear to have been launched including Zynga's ""Disco Loco 3D"", a music and dance challenge game and ""Garden of Good"", where players grow vegetables to trigger donations by TikTok to the non-profit Feeding America.

According to two sources, TikTok plans to draw primarily on ByteDance's suite of games.

While the company will start with minigames, which tend to have simple game play mechanisms and a short playing time, its gaming ambitions extend beyond that, said one of the people who had direct knowledge of the matter.

TikTok will require a licence to feature games on its platform in Vietnam where authorities restrict games depicting gambling, violence, and sexual content. The process is expected to go smoothly as the games planned are not controversial, the person said.

Vietnam's foreign and communications ministries did not respond to requests for comment.

Users of ByteDance's Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, have been able to play games on the platform since 2019.

TikTok's games are likely to carry advertisements from the start, with revenue split between ByteDance and game developers, a separate source said.

TikTok's foray into games mirrors similar efforts made by major tech firms seeking to retain users. Facebook launched Instant Games in 2016 and streaming firm Netflix (NFLX.O) also recently added games to its platform.

It also marks the latest ByteDance effort to establish itself as a major contender in gaming. It acquired Shanghai-based gaming studio Moonton Technology last year, putting it in direct competition with Tencent (0700.HK), China's biggest gaming firm.

Even without gaming, TikTok has seen advertising revenue surge. Its advertising revenue is likely to triple this year to more than $11 billion, exceeding the combined sales of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Snap Inc (SNAP.N), according to research firm Insider Intelligence. read more

176,WhatsApp to launch cloudbased tools premium features for businesses,2022-05-19 19:10:52,"
May 19 (Reuters) - WhatsApp is introducing free cloud-based API services in a push to get more businesses using the app, Meta Platforms (FB.O) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced at the company's messaging event on Thursday.

The messaging service, which has increasingly courted business users, is one of several platforms where Facebook-owner Meta has launched more shopping and business-focused features.

Zuckerberg, speaking at Meta's ""Conversations"" event, said the offering would mean ""any business or developer can easily access our service, build directly on top of WhatsApp to customize their experience and speed up their response time to customers by using our secure WhatsApp Cloud API hosted by Meta.""


WhatsApp already has an API, or type of software interface, for businesses to connect their systems and engage in customer service chats on the service, which generates revenue for Meta.

Meta, which bought WhatsApp for $19 billion in a landmark 2014 deal, said that businesses would not be able to message people on WhatsApp unless they have requested to be contacted.

WhatsApp also said on Thursday it was planning to provide optional paid features as part of a new premium service for users of its specialized business app, which is geared at small businesses.

Those features, which are still being developed, will include options to manage chats across up to 10 devices and customized click-to-chat links that businesses can post on their websites and share with customers.

Uber (UBER.N) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, speaking in a session with Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg at the conference, said a third of the users ordering rides via WhatsApp in India are new customers.

The ride-hailing company, which launched its WhatsApp chatbot in December, is now planning to further customize the service starting for users in and around Delhi and expanding to markets like Brazil, he said. read more

177,Tesla cut from SP 500 ESG Index and Elon Musk tweets his fury,2022-05-19 16:13:27,"
In it changes, effective May 2, the sustainability index also added soon-to-be-Musk-controlled Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and oil refiner Phillips 66 (PSX.N) while dropping Delta Air Lines and Chevron Corp, according to an announcement.

The back-and-forth over the index changes reflects a wider debate about the metrics used to judge corporate performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues, a growing area of investing.


Tesla has become the most valuable auto industry company by pioneering EVs and expanding into battery storage for electric grids and solar-power systems.

Factors contributing to its departure from the index included Tesla's lack of published details related to its low carbon strategy or business conduct codes, said Margaret Dorn, S&P Dow Jones Indices' head of ESG indices for North America, in an interview.

Even though Tesla's products help cut planet-warming emissions, Dorn said, its other issues and lack of disclosures relative to industry peers should raise concerns for investors looking to judge the company across environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria.

""You can't just take a company's mission statement at face value, you have to look at their practices across all those key dimensions,"" she said.

Tesla representatives did not immediately respond to questions. The company has previously called ESG methodologies ""fundamentally flawed.""

Musk tweeted that ""Exxon is rated top ten best in world for environment, social & governance (ESG) by S&P 500, while Tesla didn’t make the list! ESG is a scam. It has been weaponized by phony social justice warriors.""

Asked about the tweet, a representative for the index provider said Musk may have been referring to a list on a company blog post of the largest 10 constituents by market cap of the S&P 500 ESG Index after the removal of Tesla and others. The list is ""not a ranking of best companies by ESG score,"" the representative said.

Exxon now accounts for 1.443% of the weight of the index. Apple Inc was the largest at 9.657%.

GROWING CONCERNS

Investors concerned about issues like diversity and climate change have poured billions of dollars into funds using ESG criteria to pick stocks, prompting debate about how effectively the funds promote change or whether they push companies too much on issues that should be settled by government policy.

S&P Dow Jones Indices is majority-owned by S&P Global Inc. (SPGI.N) Musk and others have complained the firm and its rivals conflate too many issues by bundling ESG concerns into one total score.

For instance a fund based on the S&P 500 ESG Index, the SPDR S&P 500 ESG ETF, received the low rating ""D"" by climate activist research group As You Sow, which noted despite its title and sustainability mandate, fossil fuel stocks make up 6.5% of fund assets.

In the company blog post reviewing changes from April 22, S&P's Dorn said the index aims to keep industries weighted the same as they are in the regular S&P 500 index ""while enhancing the overall sustainability profile of the index."" In practice that means it can keep oil companies while leaving out big players like Facebook parent Meta Platforms (FB.O) and Wells Fargo & Co.(WFC.N)

Dorn said Tesla's ESG score had declined slightly from the ""22"" it received last year. At the same time the average score among other automakers improved, pushing Tesla out of the ESG index because of a rule against including lowest-quartile performers.

Dorn and others did not immediately describe other details such as the reasons Twitter or Phillips 66 were added or other companies dropped.

Among other big ESG ratings agencies, MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) gives Tesla an ""average"" ESG rating, while the Sustainalytics unit of Morningstar Inc gives Tesla a ""medium risk"" rating, according to the firms' websites.

On Wednesday a U.S. safety regulator opened a special crash investigation into a Tesla crash this month in California, among more than 30 crashes under investigation involving advanced driver assistance systems. [nL2N2XA2CY]

178,Im 33 and earn 120K I have 300K in company stock and 56K in debt Im partially supporting my partner sadly due to his failing business What should be my next move,2022-05-20 14:41:00,"I am 33 years old, I currently make just over $120,000 a year, including an annual bonus, and my company has gifted me with around $300,000 in equity in the firm, although our stock is brand new, so it is constantly swinging up and down. I put around 6% toward a 401(k) and another 4% toward personal savings, investments and emergency cash.

As far as debt is concerned, I have around $35,000 in student loans, $5,000 in credit-card debt and $16,000 in personal loans. I do not have a car payment. I help partially support my partner of 12 years as his business is, sadly, failing, but he will not let go of the business. So, some of my income goes to helping him cover bills and expenses.

The big question is, should I sell my company equity to pay off my debt? Or, should I continue to pay off my debt and allow my stock to grow? I realize I would have to pay some fairly large taxes due to the gains on the stock, so I need to factor that into the sale as well. Thank you so much for your input, and thank you for your column.

In Debt with Equity

Dear In Debt,

You’ve come a long way in a very short time. The median salary in the U.S. for someone of your age (25 to 34) hovers at around $50,000 a year, so you are punching above your weight professionally and with a 12-year relationship under your belt you are also ahead of the game personally, and clearly living your best life. You don’t have a car payment, which is also a plus. So far, so good.

Before I weigh into your answer, I will offer you the first of two pieces of unsolicited advice, and stress the importance of living within your means. If we could all take that advice to heart! We are all guilty of splurging — sometimes responsibly — from time to time. Your student-loan debt was clearly money well spent, and your personal and credit-card debts make up a smaller proportion of your overall debt.

That said, it’s important to clear your credit-card debt every month and — if possible — avoid paying interest rates on a personal loan. There’s no point in paying off your debts if you rack up a similar amount in the future. That should be the biggest lesson from this rather than using your monthly income vs. your stock options to get back into the black.

“Your student-loan debt was clearly money well spent, and your personal and credit-card debts make up a smaller proportion of your overall debt.”

Before selling stock, it would not be unwise to consult with a tax adviser. For what it’s worth, equity compensation awards for services rendered are generally subject to ordinary income tax at the time they vest or take ownership of the equity, says Timothy P. Speiss, tax partner at the personal wealth advisors practice at Eisner Advisory Group LLC.

“If you vested in the award in 2022, a graduated federal, state combined rate could approximate 40% (or more) before local tax, employment tax, and additional considerations and other facts. You need confirmation and should be monitoring if you have to pay some fairly large taxes due to any potential gains upon the current or future sale of the stock,” he says.

“Your debt level of $56,000 is manageable considering your gross income, and asset values; however, you should review the loans’ interest rates and contemplate paying down these amounts, especially where the interest rate — and the interest costs does not appear to qualify as tax deductible — is in excess of the investment return on your assets,” he says.

And now for my second piece of unsolicited advice: Talk to your partner about his plan for the business. You want to balance your support of his dreams with the cold reality of the business’s viability. You may need to enlist an independent, third-party consultant to help you navigate your partner’s approach to his business. You want to help him make the right decision.

“Continue to show yourself the same compassion that you show your partner and his business, but bring the same critical eye to each endeavor. It will help you both in the long run. ”

Sometimes, it’s hard to let go. But doing so could result in the sale of the business, enlisting a new business partner, a co-investor, or even starting a new venture, Speiss adds. “In considering these suggestions, the preservation of your own income and assets are critical. If the business were to cease, you could still assist him to cover his bills and expenses.”

The good news: Your debts are manageable and don’t require you to sell your company stock, something that you might regret later, and you also have other issues to deal with that are just as pressing, namely your partner’s business and your commitment to avoid racking up even small debts if you don’t have enough money set aside to pay them.

Continue to show yourself the same compassion that you show your partner and his business, but bring the same critical eye to each endeavor. It will help you both in the long run. Sometimes, it’s the stuff that you leave on the cutting-room floor — in this case, what questions you did not ask in your letter — that can provide the clearest perspective, and ultimately prove most enlightening.

179,After the Big Market Drop an Analyst Says Buy Uber Booking and Meta Stock,2022-05-20 14:37:00,"Internet stocks have tumbled worse than the general market as investors have worried about the potential for a broad-based economic slowdown. But RBC Capital Markets says the selloff is now providing buying opportunities.

The First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (ticker: FDN), which tracks the performance of the Dow Jones Internet Composite index, has declined 40% this year, compared with the S&P 500’s 19% drop.

“Post the carnage that was the Q1 internet reporting season, we zoom out to identify names looking more washed out versus those where there’s more downside risk,” analyst Brad Erickson wrote on Thursday.

The analyst said valuations have become overly pessimistic relative to fundamentals for certain companies. Some internet stocks could be more resilient, he noted, even if the economic environment deteriorates during the second half of the year.

As a result, the analyst reaffirmed his Outperform ratings for Booking Holdings (BKNG) with a $2,800 price target, Meta Platforms ( FB ) with a $240 price target, and Uber Technologies (UBER) with a $46 price target.

There have been signs the travel business will be robust for the intermediate future. Earlier this month, Booking reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings. Its management said it was preparing for a “busy summer travel season.” Erickson also expects the online travel agency to gain more market share in the U.S. and benefit from increasing cross-border international business.

And on Wednesday, Target (TGT) management told investors they saw consumers dramatically shifting spending away from physical merchandise toward “going out” experiences, which may bode well for travel.

Regarding Meta, the analyst said he was surprised with is recent conversations with ad agencies that suggested solid spending trends on the Facebook social media platform.

“FB was called out by several respondents as potentially being better insulated than other ad players,” he wrote. Ad agencies “called out FB spend as potentially being a latter cut to ad spend in the event of a broader slowdown.”

Finally, Erickson believes Uber shares are attractive after a 44% decline this year. The company has “structural advantages driver supply wise, higher incentives now de-risked, strong travel tailwinds to come.” It should also help that the ride-hailing company emailed its employees earlier this month to cut back on hiring and reduce marketing expenditures in its quest to improve profitability.

180,Meet the Wikipedia editor who published the Buffalo shooting entry minutes after it started,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"(CNN Business) After Jason Moore, from Portland, Oregon, saw headlines from national news sources on Google News about the Buffalo shooting at a local supermarket on Saturday afternoon, he did a quick search for the incident on Wikipedia. When no results appeared, he drafted a single sentence: ""On May 14, 2022, 10 people were killed in a mass shooting in Buffalo, New York."" He hit save and published the entry on Wikipedia in less than a minute.

That article, which as of Friday has been viewed more than 900,000 times, has since undergone 1,071 edits by 223 editors who've voluntarily updated the page on the internet's free and largest crowdsourced encyclopedia. Moore, who works as a strategist for a digital creative agency, has made nearly 500,000 edits to Wikipedia articles over the past 15 years. He is also ranked as one of the 50 most active English-language Wikipedia users of all time, based on the number of edits. (Wikipedia editors do not get paid.)

""It's a hobby,"" Moore told CNN Business. ""I sometimes spend a lot of time diving in and fleshing out an article, but other times I'm writing one or two sentences to get the ball rolling and watching other editors improve upon my work. I get a lot of satisfaction out of planting the seed and watching it evolve over time.""

He's credited with creating 50,000 entries, including some prominent breaking news pages such as one for the 2021 United States Capitol attack . He was also a major editor to the George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protest pages. ""I had a lot more time when we were in lockdown that I could dedicate to quality Wikipedia work,"" he said.

In the middle of breaking news, when people are searching for information, some platforms can present more questions than answers. Although Wikipedia is not staffed with professional journalists, it is viewed as an authoritative source by much of the public, for better or for worse. Its entries are also used for fact-checking purposes by some of the biggest social platforms, adding to the stakes and reach of the work from Moore and others.

The day after the Buffalo shooting, Moore created the page for the shooting at Geneva Presbyterian Church in Laguna Woods, California, where one person was killed, and five others were injured (four critically). But he's also created pages for earthquakes, wildfires, terrorism attacks and other breaking news moments.

""Editing Wikipedia can absolutely take an emotional toll on me, especially when working on difficult topics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, mass shootings, terrorist attacks, and other disasters,"" he said. ""I've learned how to minimize this by stepping away if needed and revisiting tasks at a later time.""

Jason Moore is credited with creating more than 50,000 Wikipedia pages

Moore is part of a subculture of Wikipedia users who spend hours each day contributing to the platform, helping to fulfill the organization's mission to ""create and distribute a free encyclopedia of the highest possible quality to every single person on the planet in their own language."" He calls his work as a volunteer editor ""rewarding.""

""I like the instant gratification of making the internet better,"" he said. ""I want to direct people to something that is going to provide them with much more reliable information at a time when it's very difficult for people to understand what sources they can trust.""

While anyone can contribute to a Wikipedia story, editors who are fast, reliable and resourceful have developed strong reputations in the ""close knit"" Wikipedia editor community. Steven Pruitt, for example, is perhaps the most well known Wikipedia editor -- he has made more than 4.7 million edits, more than any other user on the site. In 2017, Time Magazine named him one of the top 25 most influential people on the internet.

Some of these expert users attend Wikipedia editor conferences and meetups all over the world. ""We're kind of like ants,"" Moore said. ""You kind of find how you fit in and how you can help.""

Cutting out the noise

Although Wikipedia topics vary, it's evolved over the years as a destination for up-to-date information on breaking news. Wikipedia articles for current events often bring in hundreds of thousands of views, and other major tech companies, such as Facebook and YouTube, often use Wikipedia for fact-checking content on their own platforms. (Wikipedia entries summarize, present, and cite reliable sources, along with links to helpful resources that may otherwise be considered tangential in a traditional news article.)

Lane Rasberry, who is employed at the School of Data Science at the University of Virginia and was a volunteer Wikipedia editor for 10 years, said there's also an allure and a culture around people involved in high-profile breaking news situations on Wikipedia.

""It is considered cool if you're the first person who creates an article, especially if you do it well with high-quality contributions,"" said Rasberry. ""Just like when a celebrity dies, there's a rush to go to Wikipedia and change their [date of] death. People like to be first ... and also make an impact"" in getting reliable and accurate information out quickly.

To help patrol incoming edits and predict misconduct or errors, Wikipedia -- like Twitter -- uses artificial intelligence bots that can escalate suspicious content to human reviewers who monitor content. However, the volunteer editors of the Wikipedia community make decisions on what to remove or edit. The platform also uses admins, known as ""trusted users,"" who can apply or are nominated for the role, to help monitor content.

Rasberry, who also wrote the Wikipedia page on the platform's fact checking processes , said Wikipedia does not employ paid staff to monitor anything unless it involves ""strange and unusual serious crimes like terrorism or real world violence, such as using Wikipedia to make threats, plan to commit suicide, or when Wikipedia itself is part of a crime.

Rasberry said flaws range from a geographical bias , which is related to challenges with communicating across languages; access to internet in lower and middle income countries; and barriers to freedom of journalism around the world.

In addition, the organization behind Wikipedia has previously said it believes only a small percentage of Wikipedia editors are women. Other issues involve "" deletionism "" -- when an article is deleted because there's not enough journalism to support the topic -- and ideological bias , where Wikipedia may match the ideological bias of the news ecosystem.

Another issue is vandalism, or people who make purposefully erroneous edits on Wikipedia pages. But Moore said he doesn't worry about his own pages falling victim to vandalism because he believes Wikipedia's guidelines and policies are working in his favor.

""I've got many other editors that I'm working with who will back me, so when we encounter vandalism or trolls or misinformation or disinformation, editors are very quick to revert inappropriate edits or remove inappropriate content or poorly sourced content,"" Moore said.

While ""edit wars"" can happen on pages, Rasberry said this tends to occur more often over social issues rather than news. ""People have always assumed edit wars [play out on] Wikipedia and it does not happen nearly as much as outsiders expect,"" he said. ""Wikipedia has both technological and social structures in place, which most people find agreeable and appropriate, and which permit many people to edit at once.""

Wikipedia also publicly displays who edits each version of an article via its history page , along with a ""talk"" page for each post that allows editors to openly discuss edits.

""Administrators are very quick to block those who do not obey the rules, so if you're coming to Wikipedia with mal-intent, you're wasting your time because we will stop you from contributing to the site,"" Moore said.

Challenges exist with getting users full access to news on Wikipedia, too. Rasberry said that due to news or magazine subscription costs, some Wikipedia editors may not be able to access and cite those sources in their updates. ""Access to media and interpreting media is a major bottleneck,"" said Rasberry, saying ""news agencies [should] see Wikipedia as more of a collaborator than rival news source.""

Wikipedia volunteers have created lots of guidance on reliable news sources. A dedicated Wikipedia page on the topic notes that articles should be ""based on reliable, published sources, making sure that all majority and significant minority views that have appeared in those sources are covered.""

""If no reliable sources can be found on a topic, Wikipedia should not have an article on it,"" the page said.

Although Moore is known among friends, colleagues and those in the Wikipedia editor community as being a Wikipedia influencer, the weight of that title is far less than the fame one can acquire on YouTube, Instagram and TikTok.

""I don't spend all of my time contributing to Facebook and Twitter and these other platforms because I feel strongly about Wikipedia's mission,"" he said. ""If it was a paid advertising site or if it had a different mission, I wouldn't waste my time.""","['Samantha Murphy Kelly', 'Cnn Business']",CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/tech/wikipedia-editors-breaking-news/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220518163433-01-wikipedia-homepage-stock-super-tease.jpeg
181,Elon Musk visits Brazils Bolsonaro to discuss Amazon rainforest plans,2022-05-20 14:33:00,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Tesla and SpaceX chief executive officer Elon Musk met with Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday to discuss connectivity and other projects in the Amazon rainforest.

The meeting, held in a luxurious resort in Sao Paulo state, was organized by Communications Minister Fábio Faria, who has said he is seeking partnerships with the world’s richest man to bring or improve internet in schools and health facilities in rural areas using technology developed by SpaceX and Starlink, and also to preserve the rainforest.

“Super excited to be in Brazil for launch of Starlink for 19,000 unconnected schools in rural areas & environmental monitoring of Amazon,” Musk tweeted Friday morning.

Illegal activities in the vast Amazon rainforest are monitored by several institutions, such as the national space agency, federal police and environmental regulator Ibama.

But deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has surged under Bolsonaro, reaching its highest annual rate in more than a decade, according to official data from the national space agency. Bolsonaro’s critics say he is largely to blame, having emboldened loggers and land grabbers with his fervent support for development of the region.

During the event, Bolsonaro said the region was “really important” to Brazil.

“We count on Elon Musk so that the Amazon is known by everyone in Brazil and in the world, to show the exuberance of this region, how we are preserving it, and how much harm those who spread lies about this region are doing to us,” he said.

Bolsonaro and Musk appeared in a video transmitted live on the president’s Facebook account, standing together on a stage and answering questions from a group of students.

“A lot can be done to improve quality of life through technology,” Musk told the crowd.

Although none of the students asked about Musk’s prospective purchase of Twitter, Bolsonaro said that it represented a “breath of hope.”

“Freedom is the cement for the future,” he said, calling the billionaire a “legend of freedom.”

Musk has offered to buy Twitter for $44 billion, but said this week the deal can’t go forward until the company provides information about how many accounts on the platform are spam or bots.

Like Musk, Bolsonaro has sought to position himself as a champion of free speech and opposed the deplatforming of individuals including his ally, former U.S. President Donald Trump.

The meeting with Bolsonaro occurs just five months before the far-right leader will seek a second term in a hotly anticipated election.

182,We were surprised and appalled My wife and I enrolled our terrier Spencer at puppy day school They used electricshock collars Should we ask for a refund Or threaten to sue,2022-05-20 14:26:00,"My wife and I adopted a terrier during the pandemic. It was the best decision we ever made, aside from getting married. But this is a close second.

We had some minor issues with Spencer — named after the late Diana, one of my wife’s favorite royal figures — “escalating the play,” according to one local dog trainer, meaning she roughhoused when she should be playing more gently. It’s sometimes tricky getting the leash on Spencer when we want to take her with us or go for walks. My wife can chase her round in circles around the yard, and Spencer wags her tail and loves it because she thinks it’s all a game.

We sent her to puppy day school for a week to learn how to come when we call her, and also to play “funder” where she runs to you, darts under your legs and runs back around and expects a treat. The day school cost $120 a day, 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. On the second day, it came to our attention that they used electric-shock dog collars. We were surprised and appalled. They never mentioned this to us when we signed Spencer up for her course.

We immediately withdrew her, and expressed our anger and dismay that Spencer – who is like our child – would be given shocks to get her to do what they want. We could have done that ourselves if we wanted to, but we would never consider doing something like that. We immediately withdrew Spencer from the course. Do we have any right to a refund? We probably wouldn’t take legal action, but could we sue if we did decide to take that route?

We feel terrible about being misled by this school.

Dog Parents

Dear Parents,

Most reputable trainers know this is a decision that pet owners ought to make for themselves. They broke your trust, and lied by omission. You were deceived.

The Humane Society and PETA oppose the use of such collars, which can range from a mild tickling sensation to more severe shocks. They can create anxiety and aggression in dogs, and damage the trust between them and their guardian. Electric-shock collars — or “e-collars” as they are sometimes more delicately, if deceptively, known — use negative reinforcement. “While they may suppress unwanted behavior, they do not teach a dog what you would like them to do instead and therefore should not be used,” the Humane Society says.

Those methods use fear to get results. That doesn’t work in human relations. It doesn’t work in the workplace. It doesn’t work when making decisions when buying or selling shares on the stock market. And it doesn’t work in dog training. It may have an immediate impact and cause the dog to stop in their tracks, but positive reinforcement such as treats and praise, and giving cues that they can understand work better. In your case: Walk behind the garden gate and close it so Spencer can see you’re going on a walk rather than trying to play a game with her.

Yes, ask for a refund. Electric-shock collars, regardless of their severity, are a fast and sneaky way of getting short-term results and — some would argue, including this writer — a cruel and unusual way to train a dog. I am assuming you did not sign a document that included the mention of such collars. Burying such a reference in the small print could be regarded as an acknowledgement that the practice is controversial, but it would give them at least one leg to stand on, albeit without any of the dignity of the proud pooches that pass through their doors.

Your question threatening legal action is more complicated. It may help provide leverage for a refund, but their use remains legal in the U.S. even while the use of electrical devices for disciplinary purposes have been prohibited under laws for the prevention of cruelty to animals in many other countries, according to Pupspal.com, including Austria, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Wales, some states in Australia — including New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, and South Australia — and in Quebec, Canada.

“‘Electric-shock collars are a fast, cruel and sneaky way of getting short-term results.’”

A study published in July 2020 in the journal Frontiers in Veterinary Science trained 63 dogs who had off-leash behavioral problems such as poor recall, similar to your Spencer. They split the dogs into different groups: one using electric-shock collars, one using the same methods as the first group without those collars, and another using positive reinforcement. “In many ways, training with positive reinforcement was found to be more effective at addressing the target behavior as well as general obedience training,” the researchers found.

There has been progress on the home front. In 2020, Petco WOOF, -10.08% stopped selling electric-shock collars: “Today, we stop the pain for Buddy because he barks at the doorbell. We stop the stress for Sadie because she jumps for joy all over the neighbors when they walk in the door. And we stop the fear for Cooper because he prefers a good pair of sneakers over all the chew toys on the market.” The reason: “As a health and wellness company dedicated to improving pet lives, they have no business in our business. And frankly, we believe there’s a better way.”

There are collars that present fewer risks to dogs: vibrating collars can be useful for dogs who are hard of hearing, and flea collars for dogs to protect them from fleas, Elizabethan collars are those cones that prevent dogs from biting on stitches if, for instance, they have been spayed or neutered — a practice that is recommended by PETA, as it can prevent hundreds of thousands of dogs being born that end up on the streets hungry and alone, or are abused by humans. If only there was such a cone of shame for humans who mistreat animals.

If Spencer’s puppy day school refuses to give you a refund, tell the owner to wear a collar and have his/her spouse give them shocks when they behave badly.

See how they like it.

183,Waves of online abuse buffeted thennewly appointed director of Homeland Security disinformation panel,2022-05-20 13:13:00,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Nina Jankowicz, like many of her generation (she’s 33), was excited to share a social-media post announcing her new job on Twitter late last month when she was named executive director for a new disinformation board established by the Department of Homeland Security.

But instead of well wishes, Jankowicz’s tweet set off a torrent of sexist profanities across social media and menacing emails filled with rape or death threats that continue to follow her even after she resigned from that new job on Wednesday morning following the disastrous rollout of the program. Republicans also raised questions about her fitness to serve in the role, given past comments about former President Donald Trump and his allies.

It’s a familiar scenario, not only for those who criticize Trump, but for many women.

In part, it’s also due to a confluence of social media, a hyperpolarized world and the crush of online harassment, stalking and abuse that has driven dozens of women around the globe from powerful positions. The speed and unchecked virulence of the attacks show another way that social media can serve as an accelerant to sowing discord.

“This type of silencing and terrorizing are global, sadly, and unsurprising,” said Danielle Citron, a law professor at the University of Virginia who studies online privacy and hate crimes. “It is a playbook. And it’s downright scary.”

“ Critics, prominently including Republican lawmakers, raised questions about how the board might infringe on Americans’ free speech and privacy rights. ”

In 2018, after winning an election that made her the first female, Black legislator in Vermont, Kiah Morris said she was quitting the job because of racist threats, including from one Twitter user who threatened to stalk her at rallies.

Former Ohio health director Amy Acton, one of several female health officials across the U.S. who was subjected to threats online after recommending COVID-19 masking and stay-at-home orders, resigned weeks after protesters showed up at her house armed with sexist, antisemitic signs.

From the archives (June 2020): Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine credits outgoing state health director with saving ‘many lives’ amid Republican criticism

Heidi Allen, a member of British Parliament, stepped down in 2019, saying she was “exhausted” by “vile” online hatred she received, which included one man who posted aerial images of her home with specific threats. He was eventually jailed for his posts.

A United Nations report released earlier this year that looked at Finland confirmed what many of those women already suspected: Female politicians, regardless of political affiliation, are subjected to 10 times more abusive messages on Twitter, including hate speech that sometimes suggested the women kill themselves. The online abuse, the U.N. concluded in its report, prevents democracies from being equally representative.

For her part, Jankowicz said Wednesday she won’t be “silenced” by the online harassment and it was not the final provocation that led to her resignation. But it had a similar effect.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas decided Tuesday to pause the work of the Disinformation Governance Board after such a negative reception and growing concerns that it was becoming a distraction for the department’s other work on disinformation, according to two department officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. The board’s pause led Jankowicz to quit Wednesday morning.

“ ‘It is a playbook. And it’s downright scary.’” — Danielle Citron, University of Virginia

To be sure, the board’s bungled launch and the agency’s ensuing struggle to directly answer questions about its purpose, funding or work made the new initiative contentious from the start. Critics, prominently including Republican lawmakers, raised questions about how the board might infringe on Americans’ free speech and privacy rights.

Others expressed concerns around Jankowicz’s statements during the 2020 election warning of possible Russian involvement around the provenance of a laptop said to belong to Hunter Biden, the president’s eldest son. A TikTok video she posted to the tune of a song from “Mary Poppins” calling the story disinformation was widely criticized by conservative media, Republicans and others.

Conservative pundits, Twitter users and TV show hosts delivered a relentless campaign full of sexist attacks and misleading statements against Jankowicz. A Fox News personality questioned whether Jankowicz should have agreed to lead the board while pregnant. One far-right extremist called her “mentally ill” and a “nasty … Jew,” on his podcast, though Jankowicz is not Jewish. Last week several conservative news sites circulated a misleading claim that Jankowicz was seeking powers to edit Twitter TWTR, +1.72% users’ posts directly.

“I was trying to do important work to protect Americans from a real threat,” Jankowicz said. But, instead, she was spending time reporting a steady wave of threats about herself.

“It was horrible. It was constant [direct messages], emails, threats on Twitter, threats on other places that I wasn’t looking at. That’s obviously really scary and really unpleasant.”

184,Experts suggest using WIC government benefits to get baby formula amid a nationwide shortage  but these frustrated parents say thats not a viable option,2022-05-20 13:03:00,"For two months, Kathryn Bauerle, 21, mom of 8-month-old Lori, has been scrambling to find baby formula.

Her town of Cleveland, Ga. immediately felt the squeeze of Abbott’s ABT, -0.13% formula recall in February.

But even before the recall, there was a nationwide baby-formula shortage due to supply-chain issues related to the pandemic. The recall made a tough situation worse.

Relief could be coming, but parents like Bauerle probably won’t feel it for more than a month. Abbott announced Monday that it had signed a consent decree with the Food and Drug Administration that details the steps necessary to resume production at the company’s Sturgis, Mich., plant. Once the FDA confirms that Abbott has taken the initial steps outlined, Abbott expects to have the plant up and running in about two weeks, and formula should hit store shelves in six to eight weeks after that.

“We are such a small town, as soon as the formula got recalled and production stopped, we couldn’t find anything for two months,” said Bauerle.

Around the same time, she received a letter responding to her application to enroll in the government’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) with a local office in Cleveland. She was denied.

The WIC program gives participants vouchers or checks every month to help pay for nutritious food, including baby formula, for low-income mothers and children.

Bauerle applied for WIC at the recommendation of her doctor, who suggested WIC could help her access baby formula. Amid the shortage, groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infant Nutrition Council of America and government agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services have been recommending WIC as a potential source of formula, but that advice has sometimes proven difficult to follow.

WIC benefits can’t be used to buy formula from online retailers like Amazon AMZN, -0.07% , and in many areas, WIC will only cover certain sizes of canned formula, so parents who can’t find that specific size are out of luck. The program is only open to certain income levels, and, more importantly, it’s been particularly hard hit by supply-chain issues and the Abbott recall. “More than 1.2 million infants receive formula benefits through WIC, and Abbott is the exclusive supplier for more than half of the WIC agencies nationwide,” said Brian Dittmeier, Senior Director of Public Policy at the National WIC Association.

WIC is federally funded, and states and counties operate the program on a local level. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers WIC, did not reply to a request for comment.

“‘We are such a small town, as soon as the formula got recalled and production stopped, we couldn’t find anything for two months.’” — Kathryn Bauerle, 21, mother of 8-month-old Lori

Bauerle’s doctor suggested that she should look into WIC for help finding formula last November, so she applied. It took a few months before she heard back that she had been denied, and she did not receive an explanation about why.

After doing some research, she and her husband thought the refusal may have been related to their household income. Bauerle was pregnant with Lori when she applied, so their household may have been counted as a two-person one.

For most states, aside from Alaska and Hawaii, participants in the WIC program cannot earn more than 185% of the federal poverty level. For a two-person household, the 2021-2022 level would be $32,227, and $40,626 for a three-person household.

Bauerle is a stay-at-home mom, and her husband works in pest control, and takes home around $33,000 a year.

“I wish that there wasn’t such a defined cutoff, I mean $30,000 a year only goes so far,” said Bauerle. For families that are “technically” living paycheck to paycheck, there should be more support, she added.

Bauerle said securing formula has turned into both a group effort with friends looking out for each other and a field trip that requires hours of driving.

The worst moments come when the uncertainty and fear of not being able to find anything kicks in, she said: “Laying in bed with my daughter, cuddling her to sleep at night, wondering if we’ll be able to find a formula for her, or worrying if she’s going to be OK.”

And this fear is growing: Bauerle is pregnant with her second child. She’s scared that if the baby-formula shortage continues, her situation will become even more dire.

After Bauerle was rejected from WIC, she talked to others who have succeeded or were already on WIC, but other moms advised her not to count on the program for help accessing baby formula, due to the nationwide shortage.

For now, Bauerle said she will need to pay out of pocket for baby formula.

She said she has heard it could take up to two months to get a WIC application approved, and because of an application backlog due to a surge of applications during the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s taking even longer.

It’s a Catch-22 for parents who are already on WIC: Some have reported that their baby formula benefits don’t help at all, because they couldn’t find the formula in stores.

On several public Facebook FB, +0.80% groups organized for parents looking for baby formula, WIC parents have complained that regardless of WIC, they are paying out-of-pocket for formula for their children, because they’re unable to make use of the benefits.

“I can’t use my WIC card, I’m paying out cash for it and I don’t know what to do anymore, ” said Kathleen Ariel Bonneville, 29, a first-time mom to a 5-month-old based in Willington, Conn. Bonneville wanted to breastfeed her son Jake, but said because she didn’t get the help or instruction she needed from her hospital on breastfeeding, she has used baby formula for her son. (Her hospital in Hartford, Conn. did not reply to a request for comment.)

Bonneville finds it increasingly hard to find formula in her area — she is disabled and takes medicine to help her focus. She doesn’t drive, so she needs help hunting down formula. Recently the hunt has become longer and longer. It took her almost a month to find a few cans on Monday morning in a Walgreens WBA, +0.44% in Stafford, Conn.

“Nobody is helping you. You call the doctor’s office for your son, and they can’t help you. You call WIC, and they can’t help you, and even though it says on the news to call your doctor’s office, they don’t help,” Bonneville said.

She added, “My child is my focus now and will always be.”

WIC programs in different states instruct parents to use a mobile app to find program-approved stores and that sell formula covered by WIC. For example, New York State uses WIC2Go, and Connecticut uses WICShopper.

For Bonneville to use her WIC card to find formula, she needs to check the approved stores on WICShopper. The app usually suggests a Walmart WMT, +0.02% , which has had nothing lately.

Once Bonneville found a 12.4-ounce can, but she couldn’t buy it with a WIC payment, because it wasn’t a size that is covered by WIC.

Currently, there are over 20 baby formula products covered by her WIC benefits, most of which are in larger sizes, she said. Bonneville said the options were recently expanded.

In some areas, WIC benefits only cover Abbott’s Similac formula. Ryan Folks, 34, a hair stylist and mom to an 8-month old girl, is facing that issue. The benefits from her local WIC office in Detroit, Mich. cover Abbott baby formula, all Similac — Similac Advance, Similac Sensitive and others. The program does cover other brands such as Nutramigen or Enfamil, both made by Mead Johnson RBGPF, +2.92% , but they are categorized as “Special Formulas” that require medical documentation.

The Biden administration last Friday urged states to expand the types of formula products covered by WIC amid the shortage. As Abbott has a contract with USDA, the government department on Friday asked the company to extend rebates until the end of August so that states and retailers can plan ahead and buy any products available to help with the on-going shortage. Abbott agreed.

After the Abbot recall, the WIC office Folks uses changed its authorized formula from powder to concentrate. Of the 24 products eligible for purchase with her WIC benefits, 16 were part of the recall, by her count.

Unused WIC benefits cannot be rolled over to the next month, and although her daughter can eat some food now, she must embark on “a field trip” to find formula. When talking to MarketWatch on Monday, she was trying to find money to buy a few cans off another person without WIC assistance.

“I didn’t like that they didn’t have backup plans for us,” Folks said.

185,Why did crypto crash Mark Cuban compares crypto lull to the early internet,2022-05-20 12:51:00,"Mark Cuban, billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, thinks that cryptocurrency is on the same downward trend that tech and internet companies hit in the early 2000s.

Bitcoin hit a 10-month low in May, and sales of non-fungible tokens, aka NFTs, plummeted between January and March 2022.

Cuban addressed the slump in a viral Twitter TWTR, +1.69% thread. “Crypto is going through the lull that the internet went through,” he wrote.

The comparison between cryptocurrency and the early days of the internet has been made by Cuban and others including entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk before. The dot-com bubble burst in 2000 after several internet-centric companies received high levels of investment speculation, only to eventually bottom-out.

Cuban sold his company Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for $5.7 billion, just before the dot-com bust. Broadcast.com has since been discontinued.

The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner is heavily invested and interested in the crypto and NFT space. He claims to own several thousand dollars worth of bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.91% , ethereum ETHUSD, -3.35% and dogecoin DOGEUSD, -3.41% , according to a CNBC report, and also says that 80% of his investments that aren’t on “Shark Tank” are crypto-related.

But what’s next? While NFTs have exploded in popularity over the past few years, with creators like Beeple and NBA Top Shot selling NFTs for millions of dollars, recent NFT sales have plummeted as more creators flooded the marketplace. The average daily transaction volume on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, was down more than 55% from January 2022 to March 2022, according to crypto data tracking platform Dune Analytics.

“I think that early on, you saw lots of new entrants who were enthusiastic about this, but didn’t necessarily have a grasp of the fundamentals, and I think the cooling is a reflection of that,” Jordan Birnholtz, co-founder at NFT marketplace Neon told Distributed Ledger.

Millionaire Vaynerchuk, who invested early in companies like Facebook FB, +0.82% , Twitter, Uber UBER, -0.10% , Snap SNAP, -0.43% and Venmo, told MarketWatch in July 2021 that he, like Cuban, sees NFTs and crypto following similar paths as the early internet companies in the late 1990s.

“I view NFTs exactly the way I viewed the internet in 1999. Internet stocks and their valuations were through the roof, prematurely, and a lot of things collapsed. Meanwhile, eBay EBAY, -1.20% , Google GOOG, -2.21% and Amazon AMZN, -0.11% were all there,” Vaynerchuk said.

Cuban said somethings similar in a now-deleted tweet last January. “Watching the cryptos trade, it’s EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble. EXACTLY,” he wrote. “I think BTC, ETH, a few others will be analogous to those that were built during the dotcom era, survived the bubble bursting and thrived, like AMZN, EBay, and Priceline. Many won’t.”

Cuban’s latest crypto comments come as prices for many cryptocurrencies are plummeting. Prices for bitcoin and ether were hovering around roughly half their November peaks.

186,Apple and Microsoft Stocks Rise as Rough Week for Big Tech Ends,2022-05-20 07:33:00,"Megacap technology companies Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta traded higher on Friday, recovering some of their recent losses.

The companies had seen big selloffs as market sentiment soured over the past few weeks. Faster inflation, a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike and strict Covid lockdowns in China conspired to bring the tech-heavy Nasdaq index of higher-risk stocks into a bear market. The benchmark Nasdaq 100 has lost more than $1 trillion of market value this month.

News that China on Friday unexpectedly lowered a key interest rate that is used as a benchmark for mortgages lifted stocks worldwide. The move raises hopes that the economic slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy won’t be as bad as feared.

Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.6% in premarket trading Friday, though the index remains 15% lower than it was a year ago. Apple (ticker: AAPL), the world’s most valuable company until it was overtaken by Saudi Aramco (2222.SA) a few months ago, climbed 1.4%.

Microsoft (MSFT) was up 1.7%, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) traded up 1.2%, electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) gained 2.3%, and Meta (FB), the parent company of Facebook, rose 1.4% in the pre-market.

187,Massive paydays for tech CEOs could face investors wrath,2022-05-20 07:18:00,"Shareholders in some of the world’s biggest tech companies will vote next week on top executives’ compensation, as influential advisory services urge them to fight the massive paydays.

“Say on pay” votes are scheduled for Wednesday at Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.11% , Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. FB, +0.82% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, +1.72% , as part of those companies’ annual shareholder meetings. The votes are advisory and nonbinding, but they give investors a chance to make their feelings known about the pay of executives at some of the world’s most famous tech companies, which they have already done this proxy season.

About 66% of Intel Corp. INTC, -1.80% shareholders voted against the chip maker’s executive pay structure last week, including compensation of $178 million for Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Investors in other tech companies seeking to speak out against hefty executive compensation have backing from shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services, or ISS, and Glass Lewis, which are both urging Amazon investors to vote against the company’s executive-compensation program, saying executive pay is not aligned with performance.

New Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy, who was promoted last year after company founder Jeff Bezos stepped aside as CEO, was awarded an equity grant worth $214 million. Jassy’s stock grant vests over 10 years, starting in 2023, but ISS noted in its proxy paper that the company’s compensation program is entirely time-based, does not have preset performance criteria, and that it is unclear whether Jassy will continue to receive additional equity awards during the next decade.

“Shareholders should be concerned with this year’s disconnect between pay and performance driven by one-off awards in 2021, including a $214 million mega-grant to the new CEO,” Glass Lewis wrote in its proxy research report.

The advisory firms also expressed their concern over equity awards to two other Amazon executives, CEO of Worldwide Consumer David Clark (nearly $57 million) and CEO of Amazon Web Services Adam Selipsky (nearly $82 million).

In its proxy, Amazon said it has explained to investors its philosophy of tying executive pay to long-term performance. The company said “a small minority of investors” disagree with its approach.

ISS is also recommending that investors vote against the executive compensation program of Facebook’s parent company, saying that Meta appears to determine compensation at the discretion of the board committee; that its incentive programs lack disclosed objective metrics and quantified goals; and that other named executive officers “receive very large equity awards that lack performance vesting criteria.”

ISS further states that the security costs for the company’s top two executives, CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($25.3 million in 2020; $26.8 million in 2021) and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg ($8.5 million in 2020; $11.3 million in 2021), are “exceedingly large” and continue to rise. Zuckerberg had $1 in salary in 2021 and the only other listed compensation for him was security costs, which included a $10 million pretax allowance for personal security that he can use as he sees fit as well as $15.2 million in security costs to the company. Sandberg’s 2021 compensation was $35.3 million, which included a nearly $1 million salary, $850,000 bonus and $22.2 million in stock awards.

In its proxy, Meta said its practices are centered on pay for performance. The company also said the security costs for its top executives are necessary because of their high profiles, and that travel costs for both Zuckerberg and Sandberg were higher in 2021 because of their increased personal travel and a rise in security-personnel costs.

ISS and Glass Lewis also are recommending that investors vote against the executive compensation program at Twitter — although the company does have a pending deal to be taken private by Tesla Inc. TSLA, -8.39% CEO Elon Musk that could render moot any shareholder votes or actions at the meeting.

The advisory firms both expressed concern about a one-time $12.5 million grant awarded to new Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, who took the helm in November, replacing Jack Dorsey. ISS noted that the equity grant is time-based and not performance-based.

In addition, both firms mentioned that Agrawal was awarded another grant for $12.5 million that appears to be incentive-based, along with a $1 million annual salary. Glass Lewis said in its proxy paper that though it recognized that the disconnect between pay and performance can be affected by a CEO transition, “given the value of the awards granted and their impact on total granted compensation for 2021, we remain concerned by the company’s pay practices.”

Equilar estimated that Agrawal would receive $42 million if he is terminated within a year of a change of control of Twitter.

In its proxy, Twitter touted executive-compensation programs “designed to tie award outcomes to the achievement of financial and performance outcomes, as well as returns to our stockholders.”

Investors are voting against pay packages beyond the tech sector as well. Only 31% of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s JPM, -1.67% investors voted for that company’s executive-compensation program this week, according to a transcript of its annual meeting. CEO Jamie Dimon’s total compensation for 2021 was $84.4 million, which included a $52.6 million options award that was framed as a “retention bonus.”

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that, according to Equilar, so far this proxy season 23 companies in the S&P 500 have seen less than 70% support for their executive-compensation programs.

Dieter Waizenegger is executive director of SOC Investment Group, which among other things aims to hold corporations accountable for excessive pay for executives. He said SOC advocates a move away from performance-based incentives, “which can be too easily gamed, and instead return to a full-value time-vesting awards model.” He also said compensation-committee members on corporate boards should be held accountable “when it is clear the board is supporting unjustified executive pay packages.”

188,How TerraUSD a Digital Token Designed to be Stable Fueled a Crypto Crash,2022-05-19 21:05:00,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies went from bad to worse as selling pressure spread across the tech landscape. But the latest crypto crash was also fueled by stablecoins, a type of token that’s supposed to hold up when everything else tanks.

Stablecoins are designed to maintain a fixed value, typically at $1 per token. But a fast-growing “algorithmic” stablecoin called TerraUSD collapsed this past week to a few pennies on the dollar. That appears to have shaken confidence in the largest stablecoin, Tether. Prices for Tether, or USDT, dipped to 95 cents for a few hours on Thursday, then rebounded to nearly a dollar.

The episode could shake the foundations of crypto. Stablecoins are the bedrock of trading and lending activities, providing liquidity to individual traders, funds, and market makers on both centralized exchanges and decentralized-finance, or DeFi, networks. More than 90% of trading volume in crypto occurs in stablecoins, according to CoinMarketCap. Without stablecoins doing their job—holding their dollar pegs through periods of extreme turmoil—the crypto market may face a loss of confidence, affecting trading activity and prices for tokens ranging from Bitcoin to Dogecoin.

“USDT de-pegging is alarming for all cryptocurrency markets,” says Clara Medalie, research director at Kaiko, a crypto data firm.

This isn’t just a concern for traders and firms in the $1.3 trillion crypto market. Regulators worry that if stablecoins take off as privately issued digital money, they could pose risks to broader markets and monetary policies. A run on a stablecoin could, in theory, lead to heavy selling in assets held as reserves for coin issuers, such as commercial short-term debt. Stablecoins could also substitute for the dollar in international commerce and cross-border payments—making it harder for governments to keep tabs on monetary policies and capital flows.

“The outstanding stock of stablecoins is growing at a very rapid rate, and we really need a consistent federal framework,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, partly in reference to TerraUSD.

Bitcoin’s high volatility and drawbacks as a medium of exchange opened a door for stablecoins to step through. Tether and USD Coin, or USDC, have soared in issuance over the past few years. They’re now worth a combined $130 billion, making them the third- and fourth-largest cryptos, behind Bitcoin and Ether.

“Once you’re in the ecosystem, stablecoins allow you to act as though you have U.S. dollars, when really you own crypto,” says Stéphane Ouellette, CEO of crypto derivatives broker FRNT Financial.

The coins serve numerous purposes: Traders use them to maintain liquidity between transactions and to buy other cryptos; they also play a key role in market-making and are widely used by hedge funds and other proprietary trading firms. Tether, in particular, is the most systemically important; it’s the basis for thousands of “pair trades” on exchanges and DeFi platforms, along with “smart contracts” for lending and borrowing cryptos.

Demand for stablecoins is so high as collateral for trading and borrowing that yields top 8% on many DeFi platforms and centralized sites—and even touched 20% for TerraUSD.

There’s also profit in stablecoins, and it’s attracting banks, payment companies, and fintechs to the space. The bank Silvergate Capital (ticker: SI) aims to revive the stablecoin project originally started by Meta Platforms ’ (FB) Facebook, part of a broad push into crypto banking and brokerage products. Visa (V) is offering settlement services in USDC. The company backing USDC, Circle Internet Financial, is trying to go public via a special-purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC, called Concord Acquisition (CND). Recent investors in Circle include BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity Investments.

The New Crypto Dollars

Like every other cryptocurrency, stablecoin transactions are recorded on blockchains such as Ethereum. While transaction fees may be steep, the coins are well suited for peer-to-peer transfers that bypass traditional banking systems, cutting out intermediaries. That’s one reason they’re often used for remittances or cross-border payments. Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv began welcoming crypto donations in three tokens, including Tether.

There are basically two kinds of stablecoins: asset-backed and algorithmic. Tether and USDC are the two largest asset-backed coins. The companies backing the coins aim to maintain their pegs by holding reserves equivalent to their outstanding issuance. Every time a dollar’s worth of the coins is minted, the companies are supposed to buy a dollar’s worth of reserves; when the coins are redeemed, those reserves may be sold.

Algorithmic coins like TerraUSD are more complex. They aim to maintain their pegs through arbitrage and incentive mechanisms involving other cryptocurrencies. When the price deviates from a dollar, traders can profit through a swap with another token. That is supposed to prevent the price of the stablecoin from deviating much above or below a dollar.

Breaking the Buck

TerraUSD relied on a complex mechanism of minting and burning another token, LUNA, to maintain its dollar peg. A cascade of selling in TerraUSD destabilized its peg, however, and crashed prices for LUNA.

Crypto entrepreneur Do Kwon, based in Korea, had tried to shore up LUNA and TerraUSD with plans to purchase up to $10 billion worth of Bitcoin as collateral through the “Luna Foundation Guard.” Before the crash, the foundation held $3.5 billion in Bitcoin.

The selling pressure arose from withdrawals on a DeFi lending protocol called Anchor that offered yields of 20% on TerraUSD deposits. Roughly $14 billion worth of TerraUSD was deposited in Anchor before the crash. Less than $200 million is left.

“I understand the last 72 hours have been extremely tough on all of you—know that I am resolved to work with every one of you to weather this crisis, and we will build our way out of this,” Kwon said on Twitter on Wednesday. “As we begin to rebuild [Terra], we will adjust its mechanism to be collateralized.”

Still, the Luna Foundation Guard may be running out of money. Its reserves are down to less than $90 million worth of cryptos, and it holds no Bitcoin in its wallet. The crash also took a toll on the Terra blockchain, which briefly shut down on Thursday “to prevent governance attacks,” according to Terra’s Twitter feed. The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, also suspended trading in TerraUSD and LUNA.

Some crypto participants say that while the episode has been painful, it signals that the market is actually functioning. “The market flushed out a weakly designed system, and the speculators that were behind it took a financial hit,” says Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto data firm Messari.

Yet the crash had contagion effects. Luna’s stockpiling of Bitcoin rippled across other cryptos. Traders expecting a meltdown in TerraUSD appear to have sold Bitcoin, contributing to the token’s declines. That, in turn, weakened demand across crypto markets, which lost more than $400 billion in market cap as scores of tokens declined by more than 20%, including Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, and Solana.

USDT hasn’t emerged without a black eye, either, underscoring how contagion from one crypto can spread to others and the broader market.

In theory, USDT shouldn’t deviate far from its peg. Tether Ltd., the company backing the token, says USDT is “backed 100%” by reserves at a one-to-one ratio, and promises that investors can always redeem its tokens for an equivalent amount of real money. If a hedge fund were to send the company one million USDT tokens, for instance, the company would send the fund $1 million, even if the price differs on secondary markets.

The token also relies on arbitrage mechanisms with market makers and trading firms to hold its peg. If the price of USDT falls by even a fraction of a penny on exchanges like Coinbase or FTX, institutional traders can buy USDT at a discount and redeem it with the company, profiting off the spread, or difference, to a buck.

Those mechanics do appear to have worked. The coin was at about 95 cents on the dollar at 3:30 a.m. in New York on Thursday, but by 9 a.m. it was above 99 cents.

Why did the price get so low? Overnight selling pressure before banks opened for business may have contributed—leaving a gap between selling on the secondary market and redemptions with Tether. Moreover, Tether redeems tokens only with “eligible contract participants” such as proprietary trading firms, and it isn’t automatic.

Some market participants say USDT’s loss of dollar peg wasn’t a deal breaker for the token. “The market is functioning, and it’s expected to see minor de-risking of other stablecoins following the Terra de-peg,” says John Kramer, director of trading at market maker GSR.

Ouellette, who deals in Tether through his derivatives firm and a separate hedge fund, describes the situation as a “little spooky,” but adds that it looked like typical “arbitrage friction,” exacerbated by hedge funds that had tried to attack USDT and profit off a decline.

Still, Tether hasn’t inspired confidence with its limited disclosures and reserve practices. Based in the British Virgin Islands, Tether issues a periodic “assurance opinion” on its reserves from a Cayman Islands auditor. The last one was from December. In it, Tether said that 84% of its reserves were in cash and equivalents, Treasuries, short-term deposits, and commercial paper. The rest consisted of $4.1 billion in “secured loans”; $3.6 billion in “corporate bonds, funds, and precious metals”; and $5 billion in “other investments,” including “digital tokens.”

The company said Thursday that it had reduced its holdings of commercial paper by 50% over the past six months, and now holds the majority of its assets in Treasuries.

Still, Tether has run into legal troubles, settling charges last year with New York state and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over its reserves and disclosure practices.

“Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, Tether holds a strong, conservative, and liquid portfolio,” a Tether spokesperson tells Barron’s. Tether has maintained its stability “through multiple black-swan events” and never refused a redemption, the spokesperson adds. Tether added in a statement that “it is business as usual” and was processing more than $2 billion in redemption requests “without issue.”

Crypto Rules Are Coming

The volatility in stablecoins may only build momentum to bring some rules and supervision to the space.

The Biden administration, for one, wants coin issuers under federal supervision, potentially even carrying FDIC deposit insurance. Biden called on Congress to pass supervisory rules for stablecoins in a recent executive order on crypto.

Congress is also working on a variety of rules for stablecoins; a draft bill in the Senate would establish a process for banks and credit unions to issue stablecoins, among other measures. Sen. Patrick Toomey (R., Pa.) recently introduced a framework for regulating “payment stablecoins,” though it wouldn’t address algorithmic coins, which are looking far less stable than asset-backed coins.

U.S. regulators and lawmakers have expressed several concerns. One is about the liquidity and quality of issuers’ reserve assets—whether they can readily meet redemption requests in a panic scenario. Another growing concern is contagion to broader financial markets if there’s a run on a major stablecoin like USDT.

Many trading firms hold large amounts of USDT for market-making and liquidity. Those institutions need to be confident that USDT is fully backed and that they’ll be fully repaid in dollars when redeeming large amounts. “I don’t know too many institutional market participants that are concerned about the reserves in Tether,” says Selkis.

Yet if those trading firms were to lose faith in Tether, they may quickly try to sell their holdings on secondary markets. Without a government backstop like the Fed or Treasury Department, USDT would be at the mercy of the market, potentially causing shockwaves to other cryptos and trading at brokerages from Coinbase Global (COIN) to PayPal Holdings (PYPL).

“If you’re a regulator, I think what they’re worried about is not that the crypto community goes poof; it’s that the losses at Coinbase then feed to PayPal and then feed to a bank,” says Bryan Routledge, a professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University.

Stability Is All Relative

If anyone might emerge stronger from this, it’s Circle, the company backing USDC. Based in the U.S., Circle says its reserves now consist of cash and Treasuries, fully backing every token.

CEO Jeremy Allaire said on Thursday that the company had issued $1 billion in USDC over the prior 24 hours, which he attributed to a “flight to quality” as investors sought issuers that were fully backed and transparent. “There are others that have chosen not to participate in a regulatory framework,” he said. “Naturally, there are more questions about that.”

Circle, of course, is trying to be a model citizen as it aims to go public. Its revenue model centers partly on generating income from reserve assets and lending activities. Rising interest rates should boost the yield on its reserves. The firm is awaiting regulatory approval for its SPAC merger from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allaire said he expects the merger to be completed later this year.

Circle probably won’t be profitable for at least another year, though. It’s projecting adjusted operating profits of $677 million in 2023, assuming that USDC in circulation reaches $220 billion, with 5,000 institutional accounts and $6.4 billion in lending volume. More shocks to the crypto ecosystem would probably derail those plans, and Circle’s profits.

189,Sony Embraces Metaverse to Connect With Gamers Why Meta May Be in for a Battle,2022-05-19 15:48:00,"Sony –one of the world’s largest gaming companies—is embracing the metaverse as a way to create new experiences for game players.

The company “intends to leverage the unique strengths provided by its diverse businesses and expertise in game technology . [by] creating new entertainment experiences in the area of the metaverse,” the Japan-based consumer electronics company said on Wednesday in a release for its annual strategy meeting.

Sony (ticker: SONY ) CEO Kenichiro Yoshida added the metaverse is rising in importance, saying the company’s game division already has proficiency to generate realistic graphics, animations and sound. He also noted that the technologies in their Gran Turismo car game can easily be reused for the metaverse.

Other large technology companies have been investing aggressively in the metaverse—the futuristic vision where consumers can some day play, socialize and work in immersive virtual worlds. Meta Platforms (META), the parent company of Facebook, has lost more than $20 billion over the last three years on projects tied to the metaverse.

But Sony, unlike Meta, has decades of experience in making virtual experiences through software, developing gaming hardware, or designing custom chips. All three capabilities will be critical to win the metaverse future.

Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang agrees Sony has big advantages over traditional technology companies. “We identified Sony as the most unique metaverse stocks due to its vertical reach from hardware-based production tools and solutions to content/IP ownership and generation,” he wrote on Wednesday.

For instance, Sony is developing a new virtual reality headset for its videogame console called PlayStationVR2. While its release day hasn’t been revealed, it should play a key role in creating better metaverse-type experiences compared with competing Meta Quest VR devices.

But the company’s biggest strategic coup may be its close partnership with Unreal game engine maker Epic Games, which is known for enabling the industry’s most advanced gaming titles. Last month, Sony and KIRKBI, the company behind Lego, invested $1 billion each into Epic. At the time Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said the investments will accelerate their work in building the metaverse.

191,New Twitter policy aims to pierce fog of war misinformation,2022-05-19 13:22:00,"Twitter is stepping up its fight against misinformation with a new policy cracking down on posts that spread potentially dangerous false stories.

The change is part of a broader effort to promote accurate information during times of conflict or crisis.

Starting Thursday, the platform will no longer automatically recommend or emphasize posts that make misleading claims about the Russian invasion of Ukraine, including material that mischaracterizes conditions in conflict zones or makes false allegations of war crimes or atrocities against civilians.

Under its new “crisis misinformation policy,” Twitter TWTR, +1.72% will also add warning labels to debunked claims about ongoing humanitarian crises, the San Francisco-based company said. Users won’t be able to like, forward or respond to posts that violate the new rules.

The changes make Twitter the latest social platform to grapple with the misinformation, propaganda and rumors that have proliferated since Russia invaded Ukraine in February. That misinformation ranges from rumors spread by well-intentioned users to Kremlin propaganda amplified by Russian diplomats or fake accounts and networks linked to Russian intelligence.

“We have seen both sides share information that may be misleading and/or deceptive,” said Yoel Roth, Twitter’s head of safety and integrity, who detailed the new policy for reporters. “Our policy doesn’t draw a distinction between the different combatants. Instead, we’re focusing on misinformation that could be dangerous, regardless of where it comes from.”

The new policy will complement existing Twitter rules that prohibit digitally manipulated media, false claims about elections and voting, and health misinformation, including debunked claims about COVID-19 and vaccines.

But it could also clash with the views of Tesla billionaire Elon Musk, who has agreed to pay $44 billion to acquire Twitter with the aim of making it a haven for “free speech.”

Musk hasn’t addressed many instances of what that would mean in practice, although he has said that Twitter should only take down posts that violate the law, which taken literally would prevent action against most misinformation, personal attacks and harassment. He has also criticized the algorithms used by Twitter and other social platforms to recommend particular posts to individuals.

The policy was written broadly to cover misinformation during other conflicts, natural disasters, humanitarian crises or “any situation where there’s a widespread threat to health and safety,” Roth said.

Twitter said it will rely on a variety of credible sources to determine when a post is misleading. Those sources will include humanitarian groups, conflict monitors and journalists.

A senior Ukrainian cybersecurity official, Victor Zhora, welcomed Twitter’s new screening policy and said that it’s up to the global community to “find proper approaches to prevent the sowing of misinformation across social networks.”

While the results have been mixed, Twitter’s efforts to address misinformation about the Ukraine conflict exceed those of other platforms that have chosen a more hands-off approach, like Telegram, which is popular in Eastern Europe.

Asked specifically about the Telegram platform, where Russian government disinformation is rampant but Ukraine’s leaders also reaches a wide audience, Zhora said the question was “tricky but very important.” That’s because the kind of misinformation disseminated without constraint on Telegram “to some extent led to this war.”

Since the Russian invasion began in February, social media platforms like Twitter and Meta, the owner of Facebook FB, +0.80% and Instagram, have tried to address a rise in war-related misinformation by labeling posts from Russian state-controlled media and diplomats. They’ve also de-emphasized some material so it no longer turns up in searches or automatic recommendations.

Emerson Brooking, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab and expert on social media and disinformation, said that the conflict in Ukraine shows how easily misinformation can spread online during conflict, and the need for platforms to respond.

“This is a conflict that has played out on the internet, and one that has driven extraordinarily rapid changes in tech policy,” he said.

192,Google is the target of a new Senate bill that seeks to break up onlinead businesses,2022-05-19 13:00:00,"As the clock ticks down on congressional attempts to rewrite antitrust laws in the tech industry this year, arguably the most aggressive bill yet emerged Thursday to rein in the digital advertising market.

The Competition and Transparency in Digital Advertising Act, supported by Senate Republicans and Democrats, targets the most dominant online-ad player, Alphabet Inc.’s Google GOOGL, -2.20% GOOG, -2.16% , and could force each to splinter their labyrinth business operations.

Led by Sen. Mike Lee (R., Utah) and co-sponsored by Ted Cruz (R., Texas), Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D., Conn.), the legislation bars companies processing more than $20 billion in digital ad transactions annually from participating in more than one part of the digital advertising ecosystem. Google’s web of businesses operations, for example, enables companies to sell and buy ads, as well as the auction houses, or exchanges, where transactions occur.

The bill addresses charges made in a 2020 antitrust lawsuit against Google filed by more than a dozen state attorneys generals, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton. The suit claims Google misled advertisers and publishers for years about the pricing and processes of its ad auctions.

In a forceful response, Google said the bill would irrevocably harm publishers and advertisers, leading to diminished ad quality and privacy.

“Advertising tools from Google and many competitors help American websites and apps fund their content, help businesses grow, and help protect users from privacy risks and misleading ads,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to MarketWatch. “Breaking those tools would hurt publishers and advertisers, lower ad quality, and create new privacy risks. And, at a time of heightened inflation, it would handicap small businesses looking for easy and effective ways to grow online. The real issue is low-quality data brokers who threaten Americans’ privacy and flood them with spammy ads. In short, this is the wrong bill, at the wrong time, aimed at the wrong target.”

Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. FB, +0.80% , the second-largest digital ad company, declined comment.

Should the bill become law, companies like Google and Facebook would have a year to comply with the new rules. Similar legislation is being considered in the House, in a separate effort led by Reps. Ken Buck (R., Colo.) and Pramila Jayapal (D., Wash).

It remains to be seen, however, if any of the raft of antitrust tech bills wending their way through Congress will become law as the legislative branch nears its summer recess weighed down by issues such as Roe v. Wade, inflation, the war in Ukraine, supply-chain constraints and other pressing matters.

There is the possibility Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., could put tech antitrust legislation up for a vote by early summer, according to an Axios report.

193,10 years after Facebooks recordbreaking IPO a sense of dj vu,2022-05-19 07:20:00,"After a record-breaking initial public offering, Facebook Inc. shares plunged more than 30% in their first year before a Wall Street rise that made that freshman year seem like an anomaly.

In its first year under the new name of Meta Platforms Inc. FB, +0.81% , however, Facebook performed even worse.

On May 18, 2012, Facebook became the first U.S. company to go public at an initial valuation topping $100 billion, kicking off a wave of Silicon Valley IPOs for the then-new category of “unicorn” startups. The IPO was beset by issues, however: Nasdaq bungled the bidding process, leaving investors unsure if they had actually received the Facebook shares they wanted, and underwriting banks reportedly had to step in and buy the stock to keep it higher than the $38 IPO price.

From that day: Facebook’s IPO — success or failure?

Shares closed higher than $38 that first day, at $38.23, but plunged more than 10% the following day and failed to touch the IPO price again for more than a year. Despite raising $6.8 billion at a record-breaking valuation, the IPO was derided as “The Faceplant” while Facebook shares fell lower than $20 in their first year of trading and ended year 1 down more than 30%.

The reason for Facebook’s freshman flop centered on doubts about the company’s ability to transition from a product built for personal computers to a new era centered about smartphones, thanks to the 2007 birth of Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -0.98% iPhone. By the end of that first year as a public company, though, Facebook was getting roughly one-third of its advertising revenue from its mobile offering, and Mark Zuckerberg’s baby grew to one of the largest and most valuable tech companies in the world while swallowing Instagram and WhatsApp.

In year two, Facebook stock more than doubled, gaining 121.3%, and even as the company faced public recrimination for allowing disinformation and misinformation on its platforms and many other missteps in subsequent years, Facebook stock did not have another down year.

Until the past one. From May 18, 2021, through Tuesday, Facebook shed more than one-third of its valuation, declining 35.8%, according to Dow Jones Market Data Group. That is even worse than the percentage performance from its first year as a public company, a 31.3% decline, and much worse from a valuation perspective: While Facebook was worth $104 billion at IPO time, the decline of the past year has cost it $346.6 billion in market cap.

Much of Facebook’s current troubles, like its year-one trouble, involve Apple and its mobile ecosystem. Apple has changed its permissions for online-advertising providers that can shield more of its users’ data and activity from outside entities, which has caused problems for Facebook and other social-media companies. After Chief Financial Officer David Wehner warned that Apple’s changes could cost Facebook $10 billion in 2022 earlier this year, Facebook set a record by losing more than $200 billion in market cap in a single session.

That decline came after Facebook’s first quarterly earnings report with a new name: Meta. Zuckerberg renamed the company to focus on the “metaverse,” which he sells as a magical new online reality but is, in our reality, another name for immersive products like Roblox Corp. RBLX, -9.81% The metaverse push relies on Facebook’s 2014 acquisition of virtual-reality company Oculus, and it is expected to soon face a familiar foe in that arena: Apple.

Apple is expected to introduce its long-awaited augmented-reality hardware at some point this year, and the two sides have been gearing for another fight. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook has made privacy and security his key talking points in recent years, aiming specifically at Zuckerberg, who has not shied away from a fight with the company that has bedeviled his own repeatedly over the years.

Wall Street analysts still believe in Facebook’s future. As of the 10th anniversary of its IPO, 40 of the 56 analysts tracking the stock rate it the equivalent of a “Buy,” while only one rates the stock a “Sell.” The average price target as of Wednesday was $288.51, a 48.7% premium to its going rate.

194,MC Saatchi agrees to 390 million takeover by Next Fifteen,2022-05-20 10:42:56,"
LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - British advertising group M&C Saatchi (SAA.L) has agreed a takeover by consultancy Next Fifteen Communications (NFC.L), which it said on Friday represented a better offer than one made by its biggest shareholder.

M&C, founded in 1995 by brothers Maurice and Charles Saatchi, has been recovering from a 2019 accounting scandal but last month reported a record annual profit helped by client wins and deepened relationships with the likes of Alphabet's (GOOGL.O) Google, Uber (UBER.N) and TikTok.

It has been fighting a takeover attempt by its largest shareholder Vin Murria and this week rejected a deal worth 254 million pounds. read more


The Next Fifteen offer was worth 310 million pounds ($387 million), valuing its shares at 247.2 pence apiece, M&C said on Friday, adding that its senior staff fully backed the deal.

M&C and Next Fifteen said in a joint statement that their deal would help establish a much stronger competitor in digital marketing and consulting, bringing together blue-chip clients and an array of services and providing more firepower to invest.

""M&C Saatchi is synonymous with creativity and strategy, whereas Next Fifteen has built a reputation around its technology and data driven offering,"" said Tim Dyson, CEO of Next Fifteen. ""This makes for a great combination.""

Shares in M&C soared by as much as 38%, to levels not seen since 2019, but remained below the offer price.

The stock was trading at 221 pence by 0812 GMT, giving it a market value of around 270 million pounds. At their peak in 2018, M&C shares were worth 430 pence apiece.

Murria's AdvancedadvT investment vehicle said it was considering its options, noting it owned 22.3% of M&C's stock.

195,WhatsApp to launch cloudbased tools premium features for businesses,2022-05-19 19:10:52,"
May 19 (Reuters) - WhatsApp is introducing free cloud-based API services in a push to get more businesses using the app, Meta Platforms (FB.O) CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced at the company's messaging event on Thursday.

The messaging service, which has increasingly courted business users, is one of several platforms where Facebook-owner Meta has launched more shopping and business-focused features.

Zuckerberg, speaking at Meta's ""Conversations"" event, said the offering would mean ""any business or developer can easily access our service, build directly on top of WhatsApp to customize their experience and speed up their response time to customers by using our secure WhatsApp Cloud API hosted by Meta.""


WhatsApp already has an API, or type of software interface, for businesses to connect their systems and engage in customer service chats on the service, which generates revenue for Meta.

Meta, which bought WhatsApp for $19 billion in a landmark 2014 deal, said that businesses would not be able to message people on WhatsApp unless they have requested to be contacted.

WhatsApp also said on Thursday it was planning to provide optional paid features as part of a new premium service for users of its specialized business app, which is geared at small businesses.

Those features, which are still being developed, will include options to manage chats across up to 10 devices and customized click-to-chat links that businesses can post on their websites and share with customers.

Uber (UBER.N) CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, speaking in a session with Meta Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg at the conference, said a third of the users ordering rides via WhatsApp in India are new customers.

The ride-hailing company, which launched its WhatsApp chatbot in December, is now planning to further customize the service starting for users in and around Delhi and expanding to markets like Brazil, he said. read more

196,Deutsche Bank enters new era as chairmans rocky decade ends,2022-05-19 17:05:18,"
FRANKFURT, May 19 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank looked to open a new chapter on Thursday as its shareholders voted in a successor to Paul Achleitner as chairman, after a rocky decade during which Germany's largest lender lost billions and saw its share price plummet.

Alexander Wynaendts, a Dutch former insurance executive, was voted in to succeed Achleitner for a four-year term as chairman at Deutsche's (DBKGn.DE) annual general meeting.

As a former head of Dutch insurer Aegon, which also had staff around the world and a large U.S. presence during a turbulent decade, Wynaendts has experience that should serve him well at Deutsche. read more


Under Achleitner, Deutsche saw multiple top management changes, entered and exited merger talks with rival Commerzbank and also paid big fines for misconduct that regulators feared could topple the Frankfurt-based bank.

""I look back today on eventful years in what was a difficult phase for our bank,"" Achleitner told shareholders.

""We have all set the course for a successful future,"" he said.

Deutsche has more recently entered calmer waters after an overhaul that trimmed its investment bank and cut costs by shedding thousands of staff. It has posted seven consecutive quarters of profit, its longest streak in the black since 2012.

But control problems continue to plague the bank, despite efforts to beef up safeguards, something Wynaendts plans to focus on strengthening further.

Introducing himself to shareholders, Wynaendts said the bank was on firmer ground and would ""maintain a strong focus on costs and controls"".

Andreas Thomae, a portfolio manager at Deka, which is a big Deutsche investor, said he hopes Wynaendts will steer the bank ""through a somewhat calmer phase"".

But in a reminder of past problems, prosecutors and federal police last month searched Deutsche's headquarters in a raid linked to suspicions of money laundering. read more

Deutsche said at the time that the search was related to suspicious transactions it had itself passed on to authorities and that it was cooperating fully.

There was a small camp of investors who lobbied against Wynaendts, saying he was spread too thinly with board positions at Uber Technologies and Air France-KLM.

Wynaendts was voted onto Deutsche's supervisory board with 97.8% of the vote.

The drying up of share listings in Hong Kong bodes ill for investment banks, who make about a third of their revenue in the region from equity capital market deals, and for the Chinese-ruled territory's status as a global financial hub.

Only $2.1 billion has been raised this year via IPOs and secondary listings in Asia's most popular fundraising venue compared to $20.7 billion by the same time last year, according to Refinitiv data, the slowest start to a year since 2013.


""One of the reasons for the IPO market in Hong Kong falling so sharply is the deteriorating financial performance for most of the applicants in the previous financial year, and it is possible that will the case for the first half of the current year too,"" said Frank Bi, partner at law firm Ashurst.

""Such adverse change effectively delays the application timetable.""

More Chinese companies are expected to either withdraw or delay filings for listing this year as weaker secondary markets are also weighing on investor appetite for new equity offerings, bankers and lawyers said.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index (.HSI) is down 14.1% year-to- date in 2022, while the MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan (.MIAPJ0000PUS) is off 14.4%.

""From the investors' point of view as well, with the markets being unforgiving, any doubts about a listing candidate's prospects will likely lead to them being more cautious,"" said Sumeet Singh, Aequitas Research analyst who publishes on Smartkarma.

""On top of the global volatility, China's COVID lockdowns and tech regulations aren't very helpful for capital markets.""

In the global listing league tables, bourse operator Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing's (HKEX) (0388.HK) ranking has dropped to 10th this year from third last year.

""We are confident in the long-term attractiveness of Hong Kong’s markets and are pleased to see a strong pipeline of over 170 active listing applications,"" said an HKEX spokesperson.

FEE DROP

The crumbling listing activity could pose a challenge to Hong Kong's incoming Chief Executive John Lee who has promised to maintain the city's status as a global financial centre.

It also presents a major problem for banks - they earned $33 million in fees for working on Hong Kong IPOs this year, compared to $221 million at the same time in 2021, according to Dealogic data.

Some were optimistic, though, given the city's strategic importance.

Although the Hong Kong market has been ""very wobbly"", the city's IPO prospects should bounce back once the volatility subsides as it's an important ""venue that bridges China with the rest of the world"", said Li He, a partner at law firm Davis Polk.

198,Oklahoma abortion ban Starbucks Amazon to cover employee abortion travel costs,2022-05-20 15:06:00,"Starbucks SBUX, +0.83% is one of the latest companies to offer reimbursement to their employees for travel costs when they seek reproductive care in other states, including abortion.

The benefit will be available to any employee who cannot access these services within 100 miles of where they live, and also applies to the dependents of the family.

Several other major companies, including Tesla, Citigroup, Yelp, Lyft, Levi’s, and Amazon, have also announced that they would cover travel expenses for workers with limited access to safe abortion procedures in their home states. Such moves from companies come as abortion rights in the U.S. are under pressure.

Several states, including Texas and Oklahoma, passed restrictive abortion laws in recent years —Oklahoma lawmakers recently approved a bill that would prohibit all abortions with only some exceptions. Tesla moved its corporate headquarters from Silicon Valley to Texas last year.

Additionally, a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court may look to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that legalized abortion in 1973. This has spurred questions about what happens next, including which states (and countries) would still allow abortion, as well as which states would “trigger” a ban on abortion if the ruling is overturned.

In fact, “Can you travel to another state for an abortion?” was a breakout Google search in the day following the leaked Roe v. Wade draft opinion, which means the search term spiked by more than 5,000%.

But some Republicans have called out companies for reimbursing workers who travel for reproductive care, like abortion, or for gender-affirming care. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently proposed legislation that would prohibit employers from deducting expenses related to their employees’ abortion travel costs, or gender-affirming care for young children of their employees.

These are some of the companies that have said they will cover travel costs for their employees seeking abortions, and how much some of them will reimburse.

Amazon

On Monday prior to the Supreme Court leak, Amazon AMZN, -0.05% told staff that the company will cover travel expenses for all non-life-threatening medical treatments, including abortions. The e-commerce giant, which is the second-largest private employer in the U.S. behind Walmart WMT, +0.06% , said it will reimburse up to $4,000 per year for such expenses.

The new benefit is effective retroactively to Jan. 1, and applies when the procedure is unavailable within 100 miles of the employee’s home, and virtual care is not possible. It is open to U.S. employees (including warehouse and office workers) or covered dependents enrolled in Premera or Aetna health plans.

Citigroup

Citigroup C, -0.73% also began covering travel expenses earlier this year for U.S. employees forced to go out of state for abortions. About 8,500 of the banking giant’s 65,000 U.S. employees are in Texas, which has banned abortions in the state after about six weeks of pregnancy.

“In response to changes in reproductive health care laws in certain states in the U.S., beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources,” the company said in an April filing.

DoorDash

DoorDash DASH, -2.21% also said it will begin covering travel expenses for abortion procedures after the Supreme Court document was leaked.

“It’s paramount that all DoorDash employees and their dependents covered on our health plans have access to safe, timely healthcare. This is one of our guiding principles as an employer,” a DoorDash spokesperson told MarketWatch. “Because safe abortion procedures may become severely limited in more states, DoorDash will cover certain travel-related expenses for employees who face new barriers to access and need to travel out of state for abortion-related care.”

Levi Strauss

Clothing-maker Levi Strauss LEVI, -1.01% announced Wednesday that the company will also cover travel costs for medical procedures that cannot be performed in the state their employees are in, which includes abortion.

The company says employees are “eligible for reimbursement for healthcare-related travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including those related to reproductive health care and abortion.”

Levi Strauss also noted that its employees are particularly impacted by the issue of reproductive rights, as 58% of the company’s global workforce is female. “Given what is at stake, business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees,” the company added in its announcement. “That means protecting reproductive rights.”

Microsoft

Microsoft says it will “continue to do everything we can under the law to protect our employees’ rights and support employees” in accessing critical healthcare. Those protections includes services like abortion and gender-affirming care, in the U.S., a Microsoft official told Reuters.

“This support is being extended to include travel expense assistance for these and other medical services where access to care is limited in availability in an employee’s home geographic region,” the statement continued.

Starbucks

Starbucks says employees and their dependents who are seeking reproductive health care can get it on no matter where they live, even if they have to travel for it. The benefit will apply to anyone who cannot access these services within 100 miles of where they live, and this also applies to workers’ dependents.

“Regardless of what the Supreme Court ends up deciding, we will always ensure our partners have access to quality healthcare,” wrote Sara Kelly, acting executive vice president of partner resources, in a letter posted to the Starbucks site. “Whatever healthcare choice you believe is right for you and your family, you deserve access to those services and the benefits that Starbucks provides.”

Tesla

The “People and Culture” portion of Tesla’s newly released 2021 Impact Report notes that the company wants its benefits to exceed the standards of the manufacturing industry. And that includes an expanded Safety Net program and health insurance offering that covers travel and lodging support for Tesla employees “who may need to seek healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state.”

While CEO Elon Musk did not immediately comment, he tweeted in September that he believes “government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics.”

Yelp

Yelp YELP, -0.58% , the crowd-sourced reviews platform, will cover travel expenses for both employees and their dependents who need to go out-of-state for abortions. Yelp has 4,000 employees, including 200 workers in Texas.

Yelp employees can submit the receipts for their travel expenses directly to their health insurance company, so “no one else at Yelp is ever going to know who is accessing this, or how or when, and it will be a reimbursement that comes through the insurance provider directly,” Yelp’s chief diversity officer, Miriam Warren, said in April.

“We’ve long been a strong advocate for equality in the workplace, and believe that gender equality cannot be achieved if women’s healthcare rights are restricted,” Warren also said in a statement at the time.

Other ways companies are supporting abortion access

Ride-sharing service Lyft LYFT, -1.98% announced in April that it will pay any legal fees for its drivers if they are sued for bringing women to clinics to receive abortions, which came as a result of the strict anti-abortion bills in Oklahoma and Texas. The Oklahoma bill, for example, would allow a person to sue another individual who “knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion.”

“This law is incompatible with people’s basic rights to privacy, our community guidelines, the spirit of rideshare, and our values as a company,” Lyft wrote in a blog post.

Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of competitor Uber UBER, -0.02% , tweeted that his company would support its drivers in the same way.

In 2021, Texas-based dating-app company Bumble, which prides itself on being women-founded and women-led, created a relief fund supporting the reproductive rights of women and people across the gender spectrum who seek abortions in the state.

And Match.com’s MTCH, +1.65% CEO Shar Dubey (not the company itself) also created a fund to help Match employees in Texas to seek abortions outside the state at around the same time.

Salesforce CRM, +2.20% CEO Marc Benioff also said in 2021 that the company would cover relocation costs for its Texas employees impacted by the state’s restrictive abortion laws.

“If you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state, Salesforce will help relocate you and members of your immediate family,” a Salesforce company memo stated.

199,After the Big Market Drop an Analyst Says Buy Uber Booking and Meta Stock,2022-05-20 14:37:00,"Internet stocks have tumbled worse than the general market as investors have worried about the potential for a broad-based economic slowdown. But RBC Capital Markets says the selloff is now providing buying opportunities.

The First Trust Dow Jones Internet Index Fund (ticker: FDN), which tracks the performance of the Dow Jones Internet Composite index, has declined 40% this year, compared with the S&P 500’s 19% drop.

“Post the carnage that was the Q1 internet reporting season, we zoom out to identify names looking more washed out versus those where there’s more downside risk,” analyst Brad Erickson wrote on Thursday.

The analyst said valuations have become overly pessimistic relative to fundamentals for certain companies. Some internet stocks could be more resilient, he noted, even if the economic environment deteriorates during the second half of the year.

As a result, the analyst reaffirmed his Outperform ratings for Booking Holdings (BKNG) with a $2,800 price target, Meta Platforms ( FB ) with a $240 price target, and Uber Technologies (UBER) with a $46 price target.

There have been signs the travel business will be robust for the intermediate future. Earlier this month, Booking reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings. Its management said it was preparing for a “busy summer travel season.” Erickson also expects the online travel agency to gain more market share in the U.S. and benefit from increasing cross-border international business.

And on Wednesday, Target (TGT) management told investors they saw consumers dramatically shifting spending away from physical merchandise toward “going out” experiences, which may bode well for travel.

Regarding Meta, the analyst said he was surprised with is recent conversations with ad agencies that suggested solid spending trends on the Facebook social media platform.

“FB was called out by several respondents as potentially being better insulated than other ad players,” he wrote. Ad agencies “called out FB spend as potentially being a latter cut to ad spend in the event of a broader slowdown.”

Finally, Erickson believes Uber shares are attractive after a 44% decline this year. The company has “structural advantages driver supply wise, higher incentives now de-risked, strong travel tailwinds to come.” It should also help that the ride-hailing company emailed its employees earlier this month to cut back on hiring and reduce marketing expenditures in its quest to improve profitability.

200,Why did crypto crash Mark Cuban compares crypto lull to the early internet,2022-05-20 12:51:00,"Mark Cuban, billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, thinks that cryptocurrency is on the same downward trend that tech and internet companies hit in the early 2000s.

Bitcoin hit a 10-month low in May, and sales of non-fungible tokens, aka NFTs, plummeted between January and March 2022.

Cuban addressed the slump in a viral Twitter TWTR, +1.77% thread. “Crypto is going through the lull that the internet went through,” he wrote.

The comparison between cryptocurrency and the early days of the internet has been made by Cuban and others including entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk before. The dot-com bubble burst in 2000 after several internet-centric companies received high levels of investment speculation, only to eventually bottom-out.

Cuban sold his company Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for $5.7 billion, just before the dot-com bust. Broadcast.com has since been discontinued.

See: How a millionaire outbid a billionaire to buy the Golden State Warriors in 2010

The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner is heavily invested and interested in the crypto and NFT space. He claims to own several thousand dollars worth of bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.91% , ethereum ETHUSD, -3.35% and dogecoin DOGEUSD, -3.41% , according to a CNBC report, and also says that 80% of his investments that aren’t on “Shark Tank” are crypto-related.

But what’s next? While NFTs have exploded in popularity over the past few years, with creators like Beeple and NBA Top Shot selling NFTs for millions of dollars, recent NFT sales have plummeted as more creators flooded the marketplace. The average daily transaction volume on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, was down more than 55% from January 2022 to March 2022, according to crypto data tracking platform Dune Analytics.

“I think that early on, you saw lots of new entrants who were enthusiastic about this, but didn’t necessarily have a grasp of the fundamentals, and I think the cooling is a reflection of that,” Jordan Birnholtz, co-founder at NFT marketplace Neon told Distributed Ledger.

Millionaire Vaynerchuk, who invested early in companies like Facebook FB, +0.79% , Twitter, Uber UBER, -0.02% , Snap SNAP, -0.37% and Venmo, told MarketWatch in July 2021 that he, like Cuban, sees NFTs and crypto following similar paths as the early internet companies in the late 1990s.

“I view NFTs exactly the way I viewed the internet in 1999. Internet stocks and their valuations were through the roof, prematurely, and a lot of things collapsed. Meanwhile, eBay EBAY, -1.11% , Google GOOG, -2.16% and Amazon AMZN, -0.05% were all there,” Vaynerchuk said.

Cuban said somethings similar in a now-deleted tweet last January. “Watching the cryptos trade, it’s EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble. EXACTLY,” he wrote. “I think BTC, ETH, a few others will be analogous to those that were built during the dotcom era, survived the bubble bursting and thrived, like AMZN, EBay, and Priceline. Many won’t.”

Cuban’s latest crypto comments come as prices for many cryptocurrencies are plummeting. Prices for bitcoin and ether were hovering around roughly half their November peaks.

201,This is the only grocery store in a three to fivemile radius Buffalo supermarket shooting made a food desert in a Black neighborhood even worse,2022-05-20 10:11:00,"The accused shooter who killed 10 people and wounded three others at a grocery store in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo was fueled by racism, authorities say.

His targeted location, a go-to spot to buy fresh fruit, produce and groceries in an area with few options for food shoppers, was surrounded by a so-called food desert — and that, too, is a circumstance shaped by racism, anti-hunger advocates say.

Food deserts — a term for areas where few stores sell healthy and affordable food, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture — “exist for two reasons: economics and bias,” said Joel Berg, the CEO of Hunger Free America. “The economics exist throughout America, in white and Black America. And the bias is unique to Black or Latinx America.”

A food desert’s “combination of economics and structural, systemic racism” is also powered by the “false belief that low-income people don’t want healthy food,” Berg added. “That’s just bunk.”

The temporarily closed Tops Friendly Market where the shooting took place is located on the predominantly Black East Side of Buffalo, a city in northern New York that researchers say is one of the most segregated cities in the U.S.

“The Tops market, which opened in 2003, is surrounded on all sides by neighborhoods where at least 100 households lack access to a vehicle and are at least half a mile from the nearest supermarket.”

The Tops market, which opened in 2003, is surrounded on all sides by neighborhoods where at least 100 households lack access to a vehicle and are at least half a mile from the nearest supermarket, according to USDA data.

Nearby those neighborhoods sit others who are at least a mile away from the nearest grocery store, according to the data, which was last updated in 2019.

During a Sunday press briefing, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said one of her concerns was the “access to food in this neighborhood. We now have a food desert.” “A lot of people in this neighborhood, they walk to the grocery store,” Hochul said. “They don’t have transportation.”

Tops, which said Monday it was “heartbroken over the senseless violence,” is arranging free customer bus shuttles to a different location, according to its Twitter TWTR, +1.77% account.



Meanwhile, Buffalo Community Fridges, a network of publicly accessible refrigerators where anyone can drop off donated food to feed hungry people, is divvying up an influx of monetary donations to its network members and to other community groups, according to its Instagram FB, +0.78% account. A post lists other local organizations where people can send donations.

Through a partnership with the state, people who need rides to go grocery shopping in ZIP codes 14208 and 14209 will be able to get $25 off rideshare trips from Lyft LYFT, -2.02% and $20 off Uber UBER, -0.00 rides to and from another Tops location, as well as a Price Rite. (More information is available here.)

“I understand that this is a crime scene, but as soon as we can get this store open and available to the neighborhood is going to be critically important to the well-being and the sense of getting back to normal,” Hochul said at Sunday’s press conference.

But the “normal” experience of grocery shopping can vary substantially by race, research shows.

“A ‘food desert’ is a space — a chunk of neighborhoods, a stretch of rural countryside or otherwise — where easy consumer access to affordable fresh food is difficult.”

A “food desert” is a space — a chunk of neighborhoods, a stretch of rural countryside or otherwise — where easy consumer access to affordable fresh food is difficult.

The Agriculture Department acknowledges there are “many ways” to define what a food desert is, and one way is a “low-income census tract with a substantial number or share of residents with low levels of access to retail outlets selling healthy and affordable foods.”

But there’s a racial component too, data show. For example, Johns Hopkins University researchers said in a 2014 study that supermarkets were increasingly scarce in Black neighborhoods. “At equal levels of poverty, black census tracts had the fewest supermarkets, white tracts had the most, and integrated tracts were intermediate,” they wrote.

One in five Black households is located in a food desert, the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. said last year.

Indeed, some advocates tracing the links between food access, race and income have said terms like “food desert” don’t fully apply and may confuse or mislead, because, they say, a lack of access to fresh, healthy, affordable food is the result of municipal decisions, corporate decisions and government subsidy support. A better phrase is “food apartheid,” they say.

“‘This is the only grocery store in a three- to five-mile radius. We were in a food desert, and I would like to say a food apartheid. This is an area, a gathering place for all of our community.’” — Rev. Mark Blue, president of the NAACP’s Buffalo branch

“This is the only grocery store in a three- to five-mile radius,” Rev. Mark Blue, president of the NAACP’s Buffalo branch, told NewsNation on Monday. “We were in a food desert, and I would like to say a food apartheid. This is an area, a gathering place for all of our community.”

Blue told MarketWatch he is thankful for Tops having a store, but noted the grocery store is smaller in comparison to other Tops in other, more suburban locations. There used to be more grocery-store options, he said. “Now through the lack of resources, people have to rely on fast food; they have to rely on the corner store,” he said.

The build-up of retail grocery stores just beyond Buffalo could have happened in city limits too, particularly in the neighborhood where Tops is located, Blue added. “I truly believe if there were more white residents in that area,” it could have been a different story, he said.

Food insecurity for Black households increased to 21.7% in 2020 from 19.1% a year earlier, according to the USDA.

It’s tough to identify the latest trends for food access and food deserts in 2021 and 2022, Berg said. Consumer-facing retail stores have faced all kinds of challenges to keep operating, but there’s also been the expansion of online grocery shopping — as well as expansions in government food subsidies — that could bring more fresh food to more places, Berg said.

But there are also the headwinds of high inflation, which are especially tough for lower-income families to absorb. Compared to low-income families in European countries, Berg said, low-income families here lack access to paid leave and free healthcare.

But at least U.S. families faced relatively lower food prices compared with their counterparts in Europe, Berg said. “If they lose even that, they are going to be even further shafted,” he said.

202,A Profit Recession Is Brewing Expert Says Hunker Down in Cash,2022-05-20 09:46:00,"If there is one person who wasn’t shocked by the massive misses in big retailers’ results this past week, it’s our longtime (but no way old) pal, Stephanie Pomboy, who heads the MacroMavens institutional economic advisory. Even though she has been coping with a (thankfully) mild case of Covid-19, she’s still as sharp, and acerbic, as ever in sizing up the current situation.

Not to lose the short-attention-span types, here are some of Steph’s searing insights:

We’re now experiencing withdrawal pangs after the massive injection of fiscal and monetary stimulus of the past two years, which actually boosted asset values more than real economic activity. With manna no longer falling from Washington, consumers are resorting to credit cards to pay the soaring costs of incidental items, such as food, energy, and rent. Companies also are getting squeezed. Producer prices are racing farther ahead of consumer prices by the biggest margin on record,

There’s also some good news. Amid the shortages of everything out there, the supply of one thing—labor—might improve. Some folks enriched by the soaring prices of assets, whether stocks, houses, or cryptocurrencies, joined the leisure class for a while. As asset prices start to deflate, some of these nouveau riche face the chastening prospect of actually having to return to work.

Pomboy says that both Wall Street and the Federal Reserve have woefully underestimated stimulus policies’ role in the current recovery. After Uncle Sam injected approximately $10 trillion in fiscal and monetary largess into the U.S. economy, nominal gross domestic product increased by about $2.3 trillion, a pathetic bang for the buck. Household net worth ballooned by $34 trillion, however, which compares with the $24 trillion U.S. economy. In effect, U.S. consumers were handed roughly two full years of income, via the increased value of their houses and of their 401(k) accounts and other securities holdings.

Now the movie is on rewind. The notion of consumers sitting on an ample cushion of savings is wrong, Pomboy says, with personal savings back to the December 2019 level. Credit-card balances, which were slashed after America received its government stimulus fix, are ramping up at a record 16% annual clip. It’s hard to imagine consumers taking on double-digit interest charges on plastic if they weren’t strapped to pay the escalating tabs at the checkout counter, gas pump, and rental office, she adds.

The stresses that dominate the everyday lives of most Americans shocked Wall Street via the first-quarter earnings reports from retailers this past week, highlighted by the 28.7% two-day swoon by Target (ticker: TGT) on Wednesday and Thursday. The soaring food, energy, and housing expenses are crowding out discretionary spending, Pomboy says. Retailers who cater to the hoi polloi can’t pass on their rising costs, resulting in massive margin squeezes that are decimating their stocks.

Yet to be seen is the effect of the now-deflating asset bubble. She passed along a chart of the JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) overlaid with the Wilshire 5000 index, which measures the broad U.S. stock market in dollars. Through the most recent reading in March, the tightening in the labor market indicated by JOLTS moved in virtual lockstep with the Wilshire.

Sometime soon, however, the reverse could happen. According to Wilshire Associates, the U.S. stock market has shed some $10.1 trillion in value, or 19.9%, this year through Thursday. The losses are relatively recent, with $7.1 trillion of that drop coming since the current quarter began, including $2.6 trillion in May, $1.7 trillion of which was torched just in Wednesday’s rout.

That doesn’t take into account the approximately trillion dollars in cryptocurrency wealth that’s evaporated globally this year, according to Goldman Sachs’ economic team, led by Jan Hatzius. Declines in household wealth point to a significant drag on spending, not so much from crypto as from conventional assets. Equities accounted for about 33% of household wealth at the end of 2021, compared with just 0.3% for crypto, they write in a client note.

Labor-force participation among younger males—crypto’s main fan base—has nearly fully recovered, the Goldman economists say. Prior academic studies have found that the wealth effect mainly affects labor-force participation among those near retirement age, who might be more apt to take their money and run.

On the surface, the jobs numbers appear to show labor demand continuing to stay ahead of supply. But peering beneath the surface, Pomboy sees confusing data. While April’s establishment survey found a solid 428,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, the separate survey of households showed a 353,000 decline in employment. While the household series (from which the headline jobless rate is derived) tends to be more volatile month to month, she has never seen such a wide split, suggesting there’s something amiss in the figures.

And recently, some big tech companies, including Meta Platforms (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Uber Technologies (UBER), have announced more restrained hiring policies. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have been creeping up, to 218,000 in the week ended May 14. That’s an historically modest level, but it’s still up from the 53-year low of 166,000, touched in March. As profit margins are squeezed, labor costs are certain to go under the microscope.

At the same time, Pomboy adds, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell wants to come across as “Volcker 2.0,” a reference to the Fed chief who vanquished inflation four decades ago with 20% interest rates and back-to-back recessions. And equity analysts have yet to seriously pare their earnings forecasts, with those for consumer-discretionary companies still pointing to 30% gains for 2022, she observes.

Pomboy’s conclusion: We’re in the early innings of an unfolding profit recession. The Fed would likely welcome wage gains if the jobs market weakens. Meanwhile, she advises investors to resist any temptation to buy the dips. Instead, she advises, hunker down in cash; the lows are still a distance away.

203,Massive paydays for tech CEOs could face investors wrath,2022-05-20 07:18:00,"Shareholders in some of the world’s biggest tech companies will vote next week on top executives’ compensation, as influential advisory services urge them to fight the massive paydays.

“Say on pay” votes are scheduled for Wednesday at Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.01% , Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. FB, +0.78% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, +1.77% , as part of those companies’ annual shareholder meetings. The votes are advisory and nonbinding, but they give investors a chance to make their feelings known about the pay of executives at some of the world’s most famous tech companies, which they have already done this proxy season.

About 66% of Intel Corp. INTC, -1.77% shareholders voted against the chip maker’s executive pay structure last week, including compensation of $178 million for Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Investors in other tech companies seeking to speak out against hefty executive compensation have backing from shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services, or ISS, and Glass Lewis, which are both urging Amazon investors to vote against the company’s executive-compensation program, saying executive pay is not aligned with performance.

New Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy, who was promoted last year after company founder Jeff Bezos stepped aside as CEO, was awarded an equity grant worth $214 million. Jassy’s stock grant vests over 10 years, starting in 2023, but ISS noted in its proxy paper that the company’s compensation program is entirely time-based, does not have preset performance criteria, and that it is unclear whether Jassy will continue to receive additional equity awards during the next decade.

“Shareholders should be concerned with this year’s disconnect between pay and performance driven by one-off awards in 2021, including a $214 million mega-grant to the new CEO,” Glass Lewis wrote in its proxy research report.

The advisory firms also expressed their concern over equity awards to two other Amazon executives, CEO of Worldwide Consumer David Clark (nearly $57 million) and CEO of Amazon Web Services Adam Selipsky (nearly $82 million).

In its proxy, Amazon said it has explained to investors its philosophy of tying executive pay to long-term performance. The company said “a small minority of investors” disagree with its approach.

ISS is also recommending that investors vote against the executive compensation program of Facebook’s parent company, saying that Meta appears to determine compensation at the discretion of the board committee; that its incentive programs lack disclosed objective metrics and quantified goals; and that other named executive officers “receive very large equity awards that lack performance vesting criteria.”

ISS further states that the security costs for the company’s top two executives, CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($25.3 million in 2020; $26.8 million in 2021) and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg ($8.5 million in 2020; $11.3 million in 2021), are “exceedingly large” and continue to rise. Zuckerberg had $1 in salary in 2021 and the only other listed compensation for him was security costs, which included a $10 million pretax allowance for personal security that he can use as he sees fit as well as $15.2 million in security costs to the company. Sandberg’s 2021 compensation was $35.3 million, which included a nearly $1 million salary, $850,000 bonus and $22.2 million in stock awards.

In its proxy, Meta said its practices are centered on pay for performance. The company also said the security costs for its top executives are necessary because of their high profiles, and that travel costs for both Zuckerberg and Sandberg were higher in 2021 because of their increased personal travel and a rise in security-personnel costs.

ISS and Glass Lewis also are recommending that investors vote against the executive compensation program at Twitter — although the company does have a pending deal to be taken private by Tesla Inc. TSLA, -8.34% CEO Elon Musk that could render moot any shareholder votes or actions at the meeting.

The advisory firms both expressed concern about a one-time $12.5 million grant awarded to new Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, who took the helm in November, replacing Jack Dorsey. ISS noted that the equity grant is time-based and not performance-based.

In addition, both firms mentioned that Agrawal was awarded another grant for $12.5 million that appears to be incentive-based, along with a $1 million annual salary. Glass Lewis said in its proxy paper that though it recognized that the disconnect between pay and performance can be affected by a CEO transition, “given the value of the awards granted and their impact on total granted compensation for 2021, we remain concerned by the company’s pay practices.”

Equilar estimated that Agrawal would receive $42 million if he is terminated within a year of a change of control of Twitter.

In its proxy, Twitter touted executive-compensation programs “designed to tie award outcomes to the achievement of financial and performance outcomes, as well as returns to our stockholders.”

Investors are voting against pay packages beyond the tech sector as well. Only 31% of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s JPM, -1.67% investors voted for that company’s executive-compensation program this week, according to a transcript of its annual meeting. CEO Jamie Dimon’s total compensation for 2021 was $84.4 million, which included a $52.6 million options award that was framed as a “retention bonus.”

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that, according to Equilar, so far this proxy season 23 companies in the S&P 500 have seen less than 70% support for their executive-compensation programs.

Dieter Waizenegger is executive director of SOC Investment Group, which among other things aims to hold corporations accountable for excessive pay for executives. He said SOC advocates a move away from performance-based incentives, “which can be too easily gamed, and instead return to a full-value time-vesting awards model.” He also said compensation-committee members on corporate boards should be held accountable “when it is clear the board is supporting unjustified executive pay packages.”

204,How inflation could help us save money  and the planet,2022-05-19 13:31:00,"Inflation has many Americans worrying — a jump in prices of groceries and gas means paying more for fewer items, and possibly constraining any savings for the future. But it could also be a chance to rethink everyday spending, and possibly even help the environment.

There’s a link between consumer spending and climate change. Much of what Americans purchase must be manufactured, placing more emphasis on resources, energy and fuel. This record inflation, currently standing at more than 8%, could be a time to revisit everyday spending and change behaviors, for the benefit of consumers’ budgets and the world, said Tanja Hester, author of “Wallet Activism: How to Use Every Dollar You Spend, Earn and Save as a Force for Change.”

In her book, Hester, who is also a MarketWatch contributor, shows the link between spending and big-picture global issues, including climate change, inequality and capitalism. Hester is also an early retiree, leaving the workforce at age 38 after switching from a lifestyle of splurging to saving. Her first book, “Work Optional: Retire Early the Non-Penny-Pinching Way,” explores financial independence and early retirement.

“For the people who are under 60 currently and hopefully have a lot of years left on the planet, we have to think of the world we want to be retired in,” Hester said.

Hester spoke with MarketWatch about the relationship between consumerism and inflation and how people could change their behaviors to save their money and help the planet at the same time. This interview was edited for clarity and length.

See: Gas is going up but this is how inflation really hurts older Americans

MarketWatch: Americans are worried about inflation and what it may mean for their everyday expenses. What is causing this problem, and what are a few ways you see it impacting their cash flow?

Tanja Hester: People are thinking of the supply side shortages and how that’s affecting prices or availability of things. We saw early on in the pandemic people hoarding toilet paper or other people trying to buy them and found the shelves were empty, so you would call that supply side shocks and that has driven a small part of this. But the vast majority of inflation is driven by two factors — one, just to put it bluntly, corporate greed. We see corporations raising prices solely because they can, not because their prices have gone up. We know agribusiness giants that control the meat supply by and large are jacking up prices even though they’re not paying suppliers more or workers more. Only 8% of hikes in prices are reflective of workers getting paid more. So there’s the corporate profit side, and the other side is overconsumption by consumers. Unlike other times when we had hardships, most people still have enough money to spend right now. Up until a few weeks ago we had a strong stock market so those profits funded people’s ability to spend, and workers got raises or switched jobs and got more pay. That ended this year, but until this year, government programs were putting more money in people’s pockets to help them spend. So people were able to spend and that means they can drive higher and higher demand for goods, then prices go up. It’s a vicious cycle at this point.

In terms of what people can do — if they haven’t, look at what they can trim back and where they can do some rearranging in household spending. From an inflation and climate change perspective, it is expensive to eat a lot of meat. It is also really carbon intensive to produce and comes with a big emission toll that affects the climate. So if you want to shift more meals to meatless — I’m not saying going vegetarian or vegan — you can reduce consumption of animal products, reduce household spending and do something positive for the climate. It can also be trying to delay other purchases. It is a terrible time to buy electronics, and a terrible time to buy a car. They are just wildly expensive. So if you can put off a purchase like that, it’s good for your budget, the planet and the exploited labor that goes into that thing. We know after the pandemic people feel very stuck, they want to travel, but airfare is expensive. If you can do something closer to home, that can reduce the climate toll of your actions and reduce how much you’re spending on travel.

MW: In your book, you talk about a connection between consumer spending and climate change — can you elaborate on that a bit for us?

Hester: Folks probably understand this intuitively but the connection between consumerism and climate change is: everything we buy requires energy to be produced and energy comes from fossil fuels burned. Emissions go to the atmosphere, which warms the planet, and then there’s also the transporting of those products. At some point, people are done using the item and it will go to a landfill, where it may be buried, where it is just wasted resources, or it might actually be recycled and then that requires more energy. Anything made out of metal requires a huge amount of energy to be produced, and the refining process is intensive. If you turn it into stainless steel with multiple metals alloyed into it, it takes a ton of fuels to burn that. We can’t do that with solar power or wind power — it has to happen with coal. So just about anything you produce or you buy is going to have some pretty big price tag attached to it that you’re not necessarily paying the price for.

Think of secondhand smoke. The price smokers are paying is not reflecting harm to others from secondhand smoke, and not even reflecting harm to themselves. They won’t pay for all of the healthcare from the impact of smoking. If you buy something in a factory, the price you pay at the store doesn’t pay for the pollution or the harm done to workers who have to work around hazardous materials, or the ones in the mines or the fields, or wherever that thing comes from. Everything we buy has a price. So if you think of it that way, the more we buy, the higher impact we are having. The vast majority of climate change is driven by people in wealthy countries. If you earn $40,000 a year in the U.S. that still puts you in the global top 10%, so virtually everyone in America is rich in a global sense. Multimillionaires are contributing much more, but we all have a role to play.

MW: There are many factors that contribute to climate change. You mentioned how meat consumption and other purchases can affect climate change, for example. How might the inflation we’re experiencing now affect consumerism and its connection to climate change?

Hester: Think of it in terms of comfort. We have been fortunate, we have bounced back from the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. A lot of folks have been doing decently well financially. There’s still a lot of hardships not to gloss over, but for many folks, it has been a time when things have been relatively simple. Inflation was low, expenses predictable. It is the times of shock that force us out of our comfort zone.

Even though this high inflation is causing concern for folks, they may rethink choices – put off that car purchase, maybe forever. Maybe it’s a good time to be able to say, could we live with one fewer car in our household or not have one at all? They could use Uber or car shares when they really need one but otherwise lean more on public transportation or walking and biking. For food, given how expensive it’s been, how can I change behaviors to benefit myself financially and place less burden on the planet and climate? If we can reduce the amount of driving we are doing, that’s a huge driver of climate change.

You can apply that question to any part of your life. Someone in an apartment in the city has fewer emissions they’re responsible for because they’re heating or cooling an apartment versus a single family home, and cars have a bigger toll than folks using mass transit. But there are opportunities for everyone.

MW: For those who have pursued an early retirement — or any retirement really — inflation isn’t the only concern. The markets’ volatility has been worrisome to many, especially after so many years of investments mostly moving up. How can people make sense of that or protect themselves?

Also see: ‘Summer travel isn’t just heating up, it will be on fire’: More travelers are hitting the road this Memorial Day Weekend, but will pay more for airfares and gas prices

Hester: This is the highest inflation we have had in more than 40 years. I am 42 and it is the highest it’s been in my lifetime — last time it was this high I do not remember. That’s true of lots of folks who are pursuing an early retirement or even traditional one.

We should expect shortages and high inflation in specific markets because of climate change. For example, Abbott Labs ABT, -0.08% and the shortage of infant formula — we should expect to see that more because we know more extreme weather events like hurricanes and wildfires, those are things that will take factories offline or disrupt transportation for key goods. Climate change will make this more regular.

It is really wise for people in their planning to think of higher inflation than what they’re planning for now. In “Work Optional,” we mention 3% inflation which is a little above historical averages, but people have forgotten about that. They’re planning for too low of inflation, and that’s just a mistake, particularly because we know healthcare goes up 10% a year, and higher education is sometimes more than that. To an extent, you can control that by leaving room for prices to go up a lot — that’s a good thing. People love to debate the question of buying or renting, but I do think there’s virtue in buying if you plan to stay somewhere for a long time. It gives you the ability to control some costs. The mortgage doesn’t go up if you have a fixed mortgage, and if you pay it off then you’re only paying for increases in utilities and property taxes. There is no way to fully protect from higher costs, but planning for costs to go up higher than we’ve done in the past — that’s the biggest thing.

For folks already retired, it’s about doing your best not to overspend. Folks have gotten complacent with markets going strong. We had a record bull market that made it easy to feel like a smart investor. Ask yourself, am I really planning for my money to last? It is a good time to go back to basics and look at your plan.

205,Opinion The worst of all worlds for investors What if higher interest rates and a recession dont tame inflation,2022-05-19 10:56:00,"There is a big debate about whether central banks will need to generate a recession to force inflation lower.

For the doves, such action is not necessary because the “cure for high prices is high prices.” And this, sort of, makes sense: With wages failing to keep pace with prices, consumers all over the world are already facing a massive squeeze on their real incomes. (Please see chart 1, below.)

Yet, not everyone agrees. As the once uber-dovish Adam Posen put it in a recent FT article: “If declines in real incomes drove inflation cycles, we wouldn’t need monetary policy. The whole reason you need policy-induced recessions is that real income doesn’t reduce inflation unless labor-market conditions ease.”

Read: A ‘summer of pain’ for the stock market

With transitory explanations of inflation now clearly out of fashion, Posen’s analysis leads us to a very gloomy conclusion: A recession may now be inevitable, perhaps even “necessary.”

And while the past few months have been painful for risk assets, there is no way a recessionary outcome is currently priced in. So far, in fact, the hawkishness of central banks has merely deflated the “COVID asset-price bubble.”

The lesson from the 1970s is not encouraging. The U.S., for example, suffered three recessions during that decade, with each downturn the result of a large spike in commodity prices, which killed real incomes.

But the underlying inflation problem never went away. Prices slowed during each downturn —as the commodity shock faded — but then reaccelerated, typically on a faster trend than before the recession. And this continued until central banks, most notably the Volcker Fed, engineered their own recession, raising interest rates sufficiently to put millions of people out of work.

In the 1970s, it eventually took extremely tight policy and mass unemployment to “break the back of inflation.” From an investor point of view, this was the worst of all worlds — countercyclical inflation (stagflation) that produced a persistent positive correlation between bond and equity returns.

So why didn’t the 1970s recessions “cure” inflation?

First, each downturn was relatively short-lived. Sudden price spikes cut spending power, but then real incomes bounced back. In today’s context, this is, sort of, good news because it points to a soft patch rather than a deep slump.

Second, workers secured higher wages even as the economy deteriorated. This effectively replaced one source of cost-push inflation (commodities) with another (labor). The whole episode is synonymous with “wage-price spirals,” essentially a power struggle between labor and capital. Productivity declined and society spent the next decade trying to figure out who should bear the burden of this adjustment, until neoliberalism (Thatcherism, Reaganomics, etc.) provided a definitive answer: By crushing worker power.

Up to that point, a young militant workforce was able to resist any sustained real-wage squeeze. And, at least for a period in the late 1970s, the private sector borrowed heavily and reduced its savings, which also delayed the moment of pain.

What does this mean today? Households and businesses can respond to the consumer price index (CPI) shock in three ways:

Spend the same in nominal terms and accept a reduction in real spending. The economy will slow, perhaps even contract, but things will improve once costs stabilize (though there is always a risk of “non-linear” effects, especially if unemployment increases and you get further rounds of contraction). Reduce savings, or borrow more, to preserve real spending power. This will limit the hit to the economy and inflation should eventually subside. But people cannot sustain this for long. Resist the squeeze by demanding higher wages. Real GDP and employment will remain resilient, but the inflation problem lingers, probably at levels that are inconsistent with central banks’ targets.

Central banks are obsessed with the third of these scenarios, which is why they are watching wages especially closely. While a 1970s-style wage-price spiral does not seem very likely — basically because our governments have spent the past 40 years dismantling the institutions that produced those dynamics — policymakers are clearly worried about the tightness they are seeing in labor markets.

The threat that wages could produce a more persistent inflation overshoot seems much greater in the U.S. (and, to a lesser extent, the U.K.) than in the euro area and Japan.

But in all jurisdictions, it is clear that the ghosts of the 1970s are causing central banks to constantly ratchet up their hawkishness, regardless of what is happening to economic growth.

Naturally, this is creating a really difficult environment for financial markets. Leading indicators are set to deteriorate, perhaps sharply, but inflation anxiety will linger, which means we are a long way from any dovish pivot from central banks. Even if this is not “the end of the cycle” — that comes later if inflation fails to settle at tolerable levels — the next few months could be ugly.

206,Jobs Report Today Unemployment Claims Hit Highest Level Since January,2022-05-19 09:22:00,"The number of Americans filing for first-time jobless claims rose to the highest level since early this year, a possible sign that companies are taking a cautious approach toward spending.

Initial jobless claims rose to 218,000 for the week ended May 14, rising 21,000 from the previous week’s revised level of 197,000. Economists surveyed by data provider FactSet estimated 200,000. This was the highest level since the 222,000 reported for the week ended January 21. The four-week moving average was 199,500, about 8,000 higher than the previous week’s revised average.

The uptick in jobless claims coincides with news of companies cutting back on new hires after seeing substantial growth during the pandemic.

Meta (ticker: FB) announced earlier this month that it’s scaling back plans for adding more employees given the resulting revenue headwinds. Amazon (AMZN) Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky announced in late April that the company has too many workers and it plans to cut back spending in the second quarter.

Uber (UBER) sent an email to staff saying the company would treat “hiring as a privilege and be deliberate about when and where we add headcount.” Online mortgage lender Better.com, meanwhile, has had several rounds of layoffs.

Bill Adams, Chief Economist for Comerica Bank thinks the focus should be on major retailers—manyof whom are reporting margin pressure and softer consumer demand. ” As an example, Target on Thursday scaled back its forecast for margins for the full year. Inflation is also eroding discretionary spending power while the stock market selloff could dampen business sentiment, he noted.

On other hand, even as initial claims have risen, the total rolls of benefit recipients has fallen. The metric called the ‘advance number for seasonally adjusted unemployment insured’ is the lowest on record going back to 1969. It dipped to 1,317,000 in the week of May 7, a decrease of 25,000 from the previous week’s revised level. It’s been hovering under 1,500,000 since April.

Jefferies economist Thomas Simons expects continuing claims to drive even lower. “More people are finding jobs than losing them,” he noted.

It’s the silver lining in what was otherwise a disappointing report.

207,Melvin Capitals liquidation may have been the mystery catalyst behind Wednesdays plunge in stocks,2022-05-19 08:17:00,"It wasn’t just Target’s off-target results that blasted U.S. stocks on Wednesday, when the stock market as tracked by the S&P 500 had its worst day in nearly two years.

The liquidation of Melvin Capital also played a major role, says Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital.

The $7.8 billion fund is shutting down, the firm announced late Wednesday. “The thing about a liquidation is that you don’t send the letter until AFTER you’ve done the selling or the vultures will come in and pick you off like a super slow ‘warrior’ at a paintball park,” said Hayes.

Melvin Capital’s 13-F filing shows the top holdings at the end of the first quarter.

“If you were wondering why Amazon, Expedia and Uber UBER, +0.03% were selling off like they were going out of business – when the exact opposite is true (they are leaders in their fields), now you know,” says Hayes.

The so-called Tiger cubs, including Tiger Global, have also been under pressure this year, with Tiger Global losing an estimated $17 billion. Hayes adds the Tiger cubs moved at once in April and early May to sell their technology holdings.

“The acute pain is now likely in the rear view mirror now that the source of the clog has been revealed. We may get a few aftershocks, but the cat is out of the bag at this point,” Hayes adds.

208,Buying the Dip Just Isnt Working Anymore,2022-05-19 06:38:00,"Stocks haven’t felt this much pain in two years, and it isn’t even a shining opportunity yet.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 tumbled on Wednesday to notch their ugliest one-day rout since June 2020. Stock-index futures signal more of the same is on the way Thursday, and there are reasons to remain bearish in the near term.

One, the so-called Federal Reserve put is gone. Wall Street used to rely on the central bank stepping in to stop bear markets with looser monetary policy. Fed Chair Jerome Powell doesn’t seem to be blinking as stocks move deeper into the red, and there is much more tightening to come.

Two, analysts say there are signs that the market has yet to fully price-in the risk of recession and cost of inflation on companies. Weak earnings from retailer Target set off Wednesday’s losses, and there are plenty more opportunities for nasty surprises in corporate results or economic data.

The good news is that things will get better, eventually. While the jury is out on whether the Fed can successfully rein in inflation at a 40-year high without causing a recession, an encouraging number of economists see inflation peaking, and remain confident that the Fed will avoid a policy misstep.

Meanwhile, stocks will need to find a bottom from which to make their big rally. That won’t happen until investors stop leaping to buy the dip—a tempting strategy, given it was a winning one over the past two years.

Wednesday saw the tech-stock-laden Nasdaq plunge 4.7%—an eye-watering one-day loss—and it was only the worst day since two weeks ago. The short-term rallies in the interim have proved to be nothing but a head fake.

Cisco Systems’ 3Q Earnings and Outlook Disappoint

Cisco Systems posted disappointing fiscal third-quarter results and offered surprisingly low guidance for the current quarter, saying China’s Covid-19 lockdowns caused supply shortages and citing costs from the Russia-Ukraine war. Its shares fell as much as 17% in after-hours trading.

CEO Chuck Robbins said Cisco could not get enough power supplies from China to meet customer hardware demand—and it doesn’t expect to catch up in the July quarter. Revenue of $12.8 billion fell short of the $13.4 billion expected.

Gasoline Prices Could Top $6 a Gallon This Summer

Retail U.S. gasoline prices, already at a record high of $4.576 a gallon on Wednesday, could surpass $6 a gallon this summer because the amount of supply in storage has dwindled amid rising demand for gas, said Natasha Kaneva, head of global commodities research at J.P. Morgan.

The U.S. has fewer than 55 million barrels of gasoline in storage, compared with 65 million barrels in previous years. Western sanctions on Russia’s oil and refined fuel cut global supplies. U.S. refiners have shipped more diesel and gasoline abroad to compensate, reducing domestic gasoline production.

What’s Next: Kaneva projects that Americans could be using up to 9.7 million barrels of gasoline a day this summer, which by August could leave the U.S. with the lowest inventory level since the 1950s. That could push prices up 37%, to an average price of $6.20 per gallon, she wrote.

Stocks have been under pressure since the start of the year as investors have dumped stocks amid worries over whether the Federal Reserve will be able to tame inflation without triggering a recession, with spillover effects from the war in Ukraine and the possibility of a slowdown in China from a rise in COVID-19 cases adding to the angst.

MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: Dow down 1.35%, S&P 500 down 1.62%, Nasdaq down 2.23%

COMMENTS:

PETER TUZ, PRESIDENT, CHASE INVESTMENT COUNSEL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA

""Is it the last of it? What did Winston Churchill say about World War II? It’s probably the end of the beginning of the bear market, not the end of the bear market by itself.""

“How long it lasts will depend on when inflation breaks. The bear market will break at the same time or maybe slightly ahead of that. We have some Fed rate hikes over the next couple of months to contend with, some inflation data too. Then things will turn around.""

“What really flummoxed investors this week, myself included, is when you have the types of companies that typically do well in economic softness, do terribly, both as stocks and as companies. I'm thinking of Walmart and Target, and a few of the other companies of that ilk. These are the safe havens you run to in times of recession.""

“If the consumer is feeling bad and makes up 70% of the economy, you just have to watch out for the next few quarters.”

TOM MARTIN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GLOBALT INVESTMENTS, ATLANTA

“The most important time in the market is typically the last hour of trading. I'd rather say that if we continue to close down in that last hour, that probably doesn't bode well. But if we get a rally in the last hour with buyers stepping in, that does give some hope.”

“The market is cumulatively absorbing the information over the last week or so, particularly with the retail earnings that we've seen which has resulted in many of those stocks getting hammered.""

“Certainly, the sentiment among consumers is pretty negative. And when you relate that to investor positioning in the market, there's been a fair amount of money with exposure to the markets that we'd like to have less and hedge funds are reducing their overall exposure. They are selling what they can, they're having to cover their shorts, but clearly, the selling of longs is overwhelming any short covering.""

“So as people adjust to this, they are looking for where that bottom is, and, you know, the consensus seems to have been prior to today that we weren't there yet. Now, whether this takes us there, down to that market level of support that might be at least a temporary bottom before we could get some sort of balance is an open question. And, you know, people looking to things like the VIX which although up today is still below levels that have in the past been associated with market bottoms.”

“As bad as the markets are reacting, they haven't reacted to the extent on average that they've reacted to recessionary environments before. So there's more to go if we are indeed going to go into a recession and have an average market decline associated with that. A lot of that is going to depend on the actual path of inflation, and on what the Federal Reserve does, among other things like the war in Ukraine and the COVID policy in China etc. So there remains a high level of uncertainty. And you just don't know whether we've reached enough of a bottom that there'll be a counter trend rally.”

BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ALLSPRING GLOBAL INVESTMENTS, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN

“We have to see if we close at these levels or not, but investors are clearly afraid of a recession. Corrections are driven by fears of inflation, recession, and geopolitics. We have the trifecta going on right now. Whether we stay at these levels or go lower depends on whether the fears become reality. The reports from major retailers increase the perceived odds of a recession being realized soon, but I’m not convinced that they’re bellwethers. A little more stimulus from China or maybe a more stable inflation print on Friday from the PCE price index could help provide a floor.”

KIM FORREST, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BOKEH CAPITAL PARTNERS, PITTSBURGH

""It's a watermark but it's relatively meaningless. Can it go lower? Yes of course.""

""Hitting this mark, maintaining it and not going lower might give investors the confidence to buy.""

""Investors are all about the worst case scenario ... so all these geopolitical things could push us lower. That being said today China rate cut gave us a positive open. It is something that, if you're a longer term investor, you need to pay attention to. This is because China's rate cut might make the Fed less aggressive out to concern for a too strong dollar.""

""A higher interest rate environment calls for lower multiples. That's what we've been doing is decreasing the multiple on stocks ... if that pressure alleviates we could get back in the business of looking at businesses.""

PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, KINGSVIEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO

""If we don't today it'll be Monday. In all of the trading that's gone on in the last couple of weeks, there really hasn't been much of a bounce. Any bounce we've had has gone away quickly. So we're going to be in a bear market today if not next week. It's more inevitable than it is anything else. It's a given, certainly with what's happened to Nasdaq and small caps. It's not a surprise that the S&P finally gets there.

""I don't think investors sell because we're now in a bear market. They've been selling all along. The question is still what does the Fed do. They have historically come to the market's rescue. We're not sure where the Powell put is this time around - or if there is one... Although they've raised rates twice, we really haven't seen any impact in the economy outside of housing.""

RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, CHARLES SCHWAB, AUSTIN, TEXAS

""It does look like we are finally going to actually hit a bear market on the S&P 500 which to me is the final straw that says you are truly in a bear market, you have to close below 3,836, which we are below that level now. Now we could get one of those late-day rallies like we sometimes get so it may not happen.""

""But the one thing that doesn’t really seem to line up as far as the washout goes, or the capitulation, is just with the VIX. Thirty-two is not a low VIX, historically it is high, but it is not at all in line with what you oftentimes see when everybody throws in the towel, I am selling indiscriminately, I’m fed up, I am just trying to save what I got left kind of thinking. We just haven’t seen that.""

""Generally, you are going to need to see something above forty and sometimes it is even way above that. If you go back to the COVID bear market in early 2020 it hit like eighty so it is nothing even close to that. I believe we are going to go into a bear market, whether that happens today or early next week I am not sure, but I am not convinced we are at the bottom yet simply because of that.""

""Now it is not required you have one of those days but you oftentimes do, we could just simply go into a continued, slow, downtrend which frankly we have been in since the second day of this year. While that doesn’t hurt as much all at once, it is like pulling the band-aid off slowly, it is going to be long and slow and painful and frankly could go on for several more months so I just don’t know. But without that big, giant volatility spike and that capitulation-type feeling I am hesitant to make any predictions that we are at the bottom.""

210,Wall St Week Ahead As bear market looms battered Wall St seeks elusive Fed put,2022-05-20 17:54:41,"
NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's determination to raise interest rates until it squashes the highest inflation in decades is darkening the outlook across Wall Street, as U.S. stocks stand on the cusp of a bear market and warnings of a recession grow louder.

At issue is the so-called Fed put, or investors’ belief that the Fed will take action if stocks fall too deeply, even though it has no mandate to maintain asset prices. One oft-cited example of the phenomenon, which is named after a hedging derivative used to protect against market falls, occurred when the Fed halted a rate hiking cycle in early 2019 after a stock market tantrum.

This time around, the Fed’s insistence that it will raise rates as high as needed to tame surging inflation has bolstered the argument that policymakers will be less sensitive to market volatility - threatening more pain for investors. read more


A recent survey by BofA Global Research showed fund managers now expect the Fed to step in at 3,529 on the S&P 500 (.SPX), compared with expectations of 3,700 in February. Such a drop would constitute a 26% decline from the S&P’s Jan. 3 closing high.

The index, which was recently at 3,840, is already down around 20% from that high this year on an intraday basis - putting it on track to confirm a bear market, according to some definitions.

""The Fed has bigger fish to fry and that's the inflation problem,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes, who is increasing his cash levels. ""The 'Fed put' is kaput until the central bank is confident that they're no longer behind the curve.""

As a result, some investors are digging in for a long slog. BofA’s survey showed cash allocations at a two-decade high, while bets against technology stocks stand at their highest since 2006.

Strategists at Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, earlier this week published a “Recession manual for US equities” in response to client inquiries on how stocks will perform in a downturn. Barclays analysts said that numerous negative near-term catalysts mean the risks for stocks “remain firmly stacked to the downside."" read more

The S&P 500 was recently down 1.5% on Friday, on track for its seventh straight week of losses.

Jason England, global bonds portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, believes the index needs to fall at least another 15% for the Fed to slow its tightening, given that unprecedented monetary policy support helped stocks more than double from their March 2020 lows.

""The Fed is being very clear that there will be some pain ahead,"" he said.

The Fed has already raised rates by 75 basis points and is expected to tighten monetary policy by 193 basis points this year. /FEDWATCH Investors will get more insight into the central bank's thinking when minutes from its last meeting are released on May 25.

2018 REDUX?

Some worry the Fed risks exacerbating volatility if it does not heed possible danger signs from asset prices. Analysts at the Institute of International Finance said stocks may be subject to the same type of selling that rocked markets in late 2018, when many investors believed the Fed tightened monetary policy too far.

“In the past, rising uncertainty and mounting recession risk have had important effects on investor psychology, making markets less tolerant of monetary policy tightening that is seen as no longer warranted,” IIF analysts wrote on Thursday. “The risk of a similar market tantrum (to 2018) is rising again now as markets fret about global recession.”

There have been signs of resilient sentiment among investors. For example, the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX), known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, is elevated but below levels it reached during previous major selloffs. read more

And the ARK Innovation Fund ARKK.K, which became emblematic of the pandemic rally, has brought in net positive inflows of $977 million over the last six weeks, Lipper data showed. The fund is down 57% in 2022.

While some investors say those are signals that markets are yet to bottom, others are more hopeful. read more

Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Zuma Wealth, believes some investors are re-entering parts of the stock market that have suffered outsized losses.

""The Fed is already seeing signs that they won't be needed as a buyer of last resort,"" she said.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank are less optimistic.

""The Fed having badly erred on the side of excess inflation in 2020/21, cannot afford to make the same mistake twice - which favors more financial conditions tightening, and ongoing high (volatility) panicky markets,"" they wrote.

Richemont cautious on China growth

May 20 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday, with a boost from defensive sectors after hopes of an economic recovery in major trading partner China were bolstered by more central bank stimulus, though they still ended the week in the red.

China's central bank cut its five-year loan prime rate by a larger-than-expected 15 basis points (bps), boosting global market sentiment even as COVID-19 cases in Shanghai climbed again. read more

Travel and tourism stocks (.SXTP), financial services (.SXFP), healthcare (.SXDP) and utilities (.SX6P) led gains in Europe, rising between 1.5% and 2.0%, lifting the pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) 0.7%.


Over the week, though, the main index was down 0.5%.

""It is not surprising perhaps that we have a little bit of a bounce today given the good news from China overnight and as we have had some very negative days this week,"" said Jonathan Bell, chief investment officer at Stanhope Capital.

Global stock markets saw another volatile week as recession fears gripped investors after weak Chinese retail sales data and dismal results from big U.S. retailers highlighted the impact from surging inflation.

Over the week, European retail (.SXRP) and food and beverage stocks (.SX3P) lost 2.2% and about 5%, respectively, while miners (.SXPP) outperformed, rising 4.4%.

Data on Friday showed British retail sales jumped unexpectedly in April, but the outlook for consumer spending remained resolutely downbeat. read more

""We think these price pressures will continue to build in the coming months,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.

""That in turn informs our view that the ECB will want to move rapidly to tighten policy. We are forecasting a 25 bp rate hike in July, but as we argue here, there is a growing chance that the ECB kicks off with a 50 bp hike.""

Luxury stocks took a hit as Richemont (CFR.S) slumped 13.1%, after the company struck a cautious note over growth in China after its full-year profit disappointed.

213,Global markets in unambiguous contrarian buy territory Bank of America says,2022-05-20 09:53:14,"
LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - The trillions wiped off global markets in recent weeks has triggered a contrarian 'buy' signal from BofA's closely-followed 'Bull & Bear' sentiment indicator, while emerging markets are seeing their toughest time since the peak of the COVID crash.

Fears that inflation and fast-rising rates will send major economies into recession have sent global markets in a downward spiral with global equities (.MIWO00000PUS) losing close to 18% since the beginning of the year. It is the worst start to a year on recent record.

BofA's analysts said their 'Bull & Bear' indicator had now moved into ""unambiguous contrarian buy territory"", given the huge redemptions in developed market stocks, riskier high-yield debt and emerging market bonds.


The week saw the largest ouflows from emerging markets debt since March 2020 and the biggest withdrawals from high yield bonds in 14 weeks, at $6.1 billion and $4.3 billion respectively BofA noted, citing EPFR data.

Across the equity space, Europe, which is being hit hardest by the Russia-Ukraine war, suffered a fourteenth week of withdrawals.

All in all, $5.2 billion exited world equities funds, while a seventh week of outflows from global bond funds saw $12.3 billion leave.

214,Take Five Surging inflation recession risk and tanking markets,2022-05-20 09:18:35,"
Meeting minutes from the world's foremost policy makers may shed some light, while New Zealand and South Korean central banks ponder how big their rate hikes need to be to keep up with the Fed. And Washington holds the key to a Russian sovereign default as a key deadline approaches.

Here's your look at the week ahead from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo and Dhara Ranasinghe, Saikat Chatterjee and Karin Strohecker in London.


1/ FED THINKING

Can the Federal Reserve tame the worst U.S. inflation in decades without dragging the economy into a recession? The bank's meeting minutes on May 25 will offer clues.

Chair Jerome Powell is confident the Fed can achieve a ""soft landing"" -- words that are little solace to equity markets as recession warnings from big Wall Street banks pile up. Having raised rates by 75 basis points since March, the Fed is expected to hike another 50 bps in July. read more

Powell has vowed to raise rates as high as needed to tame inflation. The minutes will show how tenacious policy makers expect inflation to be and whether growth is resilient enough to face much tighter monetary policy. read more

2/ A BEAR HUG

Wall Street is melting. Major stock market indexes are in the grip of bear market territory with S&P 500 (.SPX) down some 19%, the high flying Nasdaq has lost more than a quarter from a November 2021 peak. And there's no respite in sight: Barclays and Goldman predict further pain for equities as corporate margins suffer from surging inflation. read more

The selloff is widespread. Since the bond bull market peak in March 2020, a constant duration 30-year U.S. Treasury bond lost half its value, safe-haven gold is down 6% this quarter. Surging volatility means even hardened stock pickers are reluctant to take big bets. read more

Retail and institutional investors are also bearish. A U.S. retail investment sentiment index is close to a March 2009 low while fund managers are running their highest cash levels since September 2011. read more

3/ PIVOT POINT

Forward-looking Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data from the United States, Australia, Britain, Japan and euro area is worth paying attention to. And more so than usual with central banks caught between surging inflation and its impact on consumers amid a darkening growth outlook, hurt by China's COVID-lockdowns and war in Ukraine.

China bounced back quickly from an initial 2020 pandemic slump thanks to bumper exports and factory production, but the current downturn could be harder to shake off. read more

Entrenched in their inflation fight, policymakers may reach a pivot point in coming months where they have little choice but to focus on recession risk. PMIs have held up well recently, but might show how close that turning point is. read more

Global PMIs above 50 but for how long?

4/ EARLY MOVERS CATCHING UP

They were early movers, but the race is on for central banks in New Zealand and Korea to stay ahead of a Fed hot on their heels with some big-step hikes. read more

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is widely seen raising rates by a half point again on Wednesday to tame inflation though risks to the economy are rising with recent homebuyers feeling the pain of higher mortgage rates. read more

Korea's new central bank governor roiled markets by flagging a half point increase before his maiden meeting on Thursday. Falling behind the curve could squeeze the fragile won, sending imported food and energy prices soaring. read more

One of the few remaining holdouts, Bank Indonesia, is tipped to stay put a little longer when meeting on Tuesday.

5/ RUSSIA FACES DEFAULT, AGAIN

The prospect of a Russian sovereign default is back given a deadline for a U.S. license allowing Moscow to make payments expiring on May 25 and $100 million in interest payments due a couple of days after. read more

Russia's $40 billion of sovereign bonds are just one of the flashpoints after its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 sparked sweeping sanctions and counter measures from Moscow.

Also pressing, is whether gas will keep flowing to Europe as firms struggle to confirm how they can legally buy gas if they have to pay in roubles with payments due from May 20. The EU has advised companies against opening rouble accounts but stopped short of saying that this would breach its sanctions against Moscow. Russia supplies around 40% of the EU's gas. read more

215,Morning Bid Batten down the hatches,2022-05-20 07:02:14,"
A look at the day ahead in markets from Saikat Chatterjee.

Markets are starting to buckle in a week where the world's top central bank issued its most dire warning yet on the need to kill surging inflation, just as fresh signs of rapidly deteriorating growth outlook emerged.

An index of world stocks is poised for its worst losing streak on record. Safe-haven gold is down nearly 4% this quarter. Safe-haven government debt, with prices on 10-year U.S. Treasuries down more than 10% so far this year, have been given a bit of respite.


And though U.S. and European stock futures are rising on Friday after China cut its benchmark reference rate for mortgages to support a struggling economy, there is a growing fear that the world economy is lurching towards recession. read more

Berenberg economists say the chance of a mild U.S. recession is roughly 40%. And UK consumer moral hit its lowest since records began in 1974, data released Friday shows.

But there seems to be no stopping policymakers. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve chief Jerome Powell said officials are prepared to take interest rates as high as needed to kill inflation. Even some officials at the dovish European Central Bank are talking about an aggressive 50 bps hike in July.

What will turn this around? Global central banks releasing their tightening grip on monetary policy? A cessation of the Ukraine-Russia conflict or China relaxing its zero-COVID tolerance?

There is no sign of any of these happening in the foreseeable future. An index of U.S. financial conditions is still in loose territory and distance away from a pandemic-era high. So batten down the hatches and prepare for more pain.

Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Friday:

UK consumer morale hits lowest since records began in 1974: GfK read more

German April PPI, advance eurozone consumer confidence

Speaker corner: ECB's Muller, Kazaks, Centeno, De Cos, Bank of England's Huw Pill.

217,Why the looming bear market will be different,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here . You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.

London (CNN Business) When a bear market arrives, it's not pretty, especially for investors making short-term decisions. But it happens — and a recovery arrives eventually.

Quick refresher: A ""bear market"" refers to when stocks drop 20% or more from their recent peak. They're a sign of extreme negative sentiment on Wall Street and are more severe than garden-variety sell-offs.

Since World War II, the S&P 500 has experienced 17 bear markets or near bear markets, according to an analysis by LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick. Number 18 is all but certain to arrive soon.

The S&P 500 is down 18.7% from its high in early January, battered by concerns about inflation, interest rate hikes and the war in Ukraine. Most traders don't expect it to begin staging a sustained comeback for some time.

""The sour mood has been persistent,"" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote to clients earlier this week.

Historically, when the S&P 500 has entered a bear market, the average drop was almost 30% and went on for nearly a year.

That period is painful, but it doesn't last forever. And importantly, bear markets haven't always been precursors to recessions in the United States.

""In 1987, we had a bear market and no recession, and earnings continued to rise,"" Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told me. ""That may very well turn out to be the environment we're in now.""

Still, economists and investors acknowledge that the risk of a recession will rise as inflation eats into consumer spending and the Federal Reserve keeps hiking rates in a bid to combat the problem.

""The probabilities have been growing all year long,"" said Darrell Cronk, president of the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. His team now believes it's more likely than not that the United States economy shrinks later this year and in early 2023, he added.

What happens next? It's easy for every bear market to seem like the end of the world, as nervous traders anxiously eye a sea of red. But to date, every huge bust has been followed by an even bigger rally. It's just a question of when the recovery begins.

This time around, that timing is much harder to predict. Usually, a bear market bottoms out when the Fed decides its work is done and eases policy. But with inflation rising at the fastest clip in decades, the central bank has signaled that it intends to remain hawkish for some time.

""For the sake of its credibility, it has to stay the course here in terms of bringing inflation down,"" Yardeni said.

In addition to raising rates, the Fed will soon begin the process of selling the bonds it bought in recent years, another mechanism for stimulating the economy. It's never done that for very long before, which makes it harder to discern what the market response will be.

""The only time they've really done that with intent was the end of 2018 and they abruptly and quickly stopped that as growth rolled over in early 2019,"" Cronk said.

That makes it difficult to find a helpful precedent for the bear market on tap.

""There's not a lot of good models to use,"" he continued.

China is flooding its struggling economy with support

China took major steps on Friday to rescue its slumping housing market and head off a major downturn in the world's second largest economy.

The People's Bank of China cut its five-year loan prime rate — a key interest rate — by 15 basis points to 4.45%, the second reduction this year and the largest on record. Most analysts had expected a cut of five basis points, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports.

China's so-called ""LPR"" is the rate at which commercial banks lend to their best customers. It serves as the benchmark for other loans and the five-year maturity is typically used as a reference for mortgages.

The central bank's decision to slash the five-year rate is the latest in a series of steps that China has taken to tackle a real estate crisis as Covid lockdowns threaten to push the economy into its first quarterly contraction since early 2020.

Sales of new homes plunged 47% in April from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said earlier this week, while prices in 70 cities dropped for an eighth consecutive month.

Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist for ANZ Research, called the move a signal that leadership wants to backstop the struggling housing sector ""as soon as possible.""

""It also suggests that China is making great efforts to achieve its 5.5% growth target"" for 2022, he added.

Step back: The Chinese economy could shrink in the second quarter as Covid lockdowns weigh heavily on output. Consumer spending and factory production both shrank sharply last month, while unemployment surged to the highest level since the initial coronavirus outbreak in early 2020.

The property sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of China's GDP, also faces a deepening crisis.

Evergrande — one of the country's biggest developers — is undergoing a huge restructuring after it defaulted on its massive debts late last year. Analysts have long feared Evergrande's collapse could ripple across the property industry.

People are just buying sweets and booze

In the United Kingdom, inflation is at its highest level since 1982 and growth is at a standstill — a toxic economic cocktail.

But there's some good news: Brits are still shopping.

The bad news? They're spending their money on alcohol, sweets and tobacco, a sign that people are spending more time at home as their expenses rise or seeking out small, inexpensive pleasures.

Breaking it down: UK retail sales unexpectedly rose in April, the government said in data released Friday. Inflation hit a 40-year high of 9% the same month.

But dig into the data, and it's way less rosy. Yes, sales at food stores picked up — but that was driven by purchases of booze, cigarettes and treats. It's hard to argue stress eating and other indulgences reveal that consumers are thriving.

""Don't be fooled by the rebound in retail sales in April,"" Niraj Shah of Bloomberg Economics said . ""The biggest squeeze on incomes in a generation is set to further constrain consumer spending in the coming months.""

Investor insight: Concerns about the UK economy have caused the pound to collapse. The currency is down almost 8% against the US dollar year-to-date.

218,New Zealand central bank to hike cash rate by another half point on May 25 Reuters poll,2022-05-20 02:38:48,"
BENGALURU, May 20 (Reuters) - New Zealand's central bank will hike its policy interest rate by half a percentage point to counter soaring inflation when it meets on May 25, making a hike of that magnitude for the first time at successive meetings, a Reuters poll found.

The 50 basis point hike last month was the biggest increase in official cash rate (OCR) for two decades, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) signalled then that more hikes were needed to bring inflation under control after it hit a three decade high last quarter. read more

All but one of 21 economists in the May 13-19 Reuters poll forecast the RBNZ would hike the OCR by 50 basis points again to 2.00% at the meeting next Wednesday. One economist expected a 25 basis point hike.


It would be the first time since the OCR's introduction in March 1999 that RBNZ has raised the rate by half a percentage point at two consecutive policy meetings.

With inflation and supply chain disruptions not expected to ease anytime soon, the RBNZ is likely to stay on its hawkish course to contain price pressures while trying to avoid tipping the economy into recession.

""There seems little doubt that unless something dramatic comes out of left field, the RBNZ will deliver another 50 basis point hike next week,"" said Sharon Zollner, chief economist at ANZ.

""Beyond that, the path is murkier. We continue to expect the RBNZ to switch to the more usual pace of 25 basis point hikes from July onward as evidence mounts that demand is cooling.""

Economists brought forward rate hike expectations for the fifth consecutive Reuters poll and a majority, 18 of 21, now expect the OCR to reach 2.50% or higher by end-September, rather than by the end of the year as predicted in the previous survey.

The latest survey predicted the rate would reach 3.00% by the end of this year, which would still leave it below where it was in 2014 after the RBNZ last delivered four consecutive quarter-point rate hikes.

""I expect to see the cash rate hit 3% by year-end ... inflation expectations running well above the targeted 2% is a threat to the RBNZ's credibility as an inflation-fighting central bank,"" said Jarrod Kerr, chief economist at Kiwibank.

""Any further push higher in expectations will only fuel the RBNZ's resolve to tighten aggressively.""

However, a significant decline in property prices could dent household wealth and result in slower consumer spending, eventually leading to slower economic growth and rising unemployment.

With that growing concern, 11 of 18 respondents forecast the cash rate to either stay steady at 3.00% or be lower by the end of next year. The remaining seven forecast it to climb to 3.25% or higher by then.

""The RBNZ's strategy appears to be to get the foot off the accelerator rapidly and then tread more cautiously on the brake. Downside risks are real, but there's an inflationary war going on, and COVID doesn't care about monetary policy settings either,"" ANZ's Zollner added.

""If the balance of developments suggests more upside risk to inflation overall, another 50 basis points hike in July would absolutely be game on.""

219,Yearend view for Fed policy rate rises again as recession risks remain,2022-05-20 01:10:11,"
BENGALURU, May 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve will lift interest rates higher by the end of this year than anticipated just a month ago, keeping alive already-significant risks of a recession, a Reuters poll of economists found.

While U.S. inflation, running at a four-decade high, may have peaked in March, the Fed's 2% target is still far out of reach as disruptions to global supply chains continue to keep price rises elevated. read more

The May 12-18 Reuters poll showed a near-unanimous set of forecasts for a 50-basis-point hike in the fed funds rate, currently set at 0.75%-1.00%, at the June policy meeting following a similar move earlier this month. One forecaster anticipated a hike of 75 basis points.


The Fed is expected to hike by another 50 basis points in July, according to 54 of 89 economists, before slowing to 25- basis-point hikes for the remaining meetings this year. But 18 respondents predicted another half-percentage-point rise in September too.

A majority of poll respondents now expect the fed funds rate to be at 2.50%-2.75% or higher by the end of 2022, six months earlier than predicted in the previous poll, and roughly in line with market expectations for a year-end rate of 2.75%-3.00%.

That would bring it above the ""neutral"" level that neither stimulates nor restricts activity, estimated at around 2.4%.

""The pressing goal is to bring policy rates to neutral, before stepping back to judge the impact,"" Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO, wrote in a note.

""The Fed can only hope that inflation pressure stemming from high commodity prices and the pandemic's impact on labor and material supplies will reverse soon.""

Reuters Poll-US monetary policy outlook

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Tuesday reiterated that the U.S. central bank would ratchet up interest rates as high as needed, possibly above the neutral level. read more

Nearly 75% of respondents to an additional question in the poll - 29 of 40 - said the Fed's rate hike path was more likely to be faster over the coming months than slower.

Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), was forecast to average 7.1% this year, and remain above the central bank's target until 2024 at least.

The New York Fed's latest global supply chain pressure gauge rose in April after four months of declines, suggesting those price pressures remain very much alive, as did a recent Reuters analysis. read more

Meanwhile the poll showed a median 40% probability of a U.S. recession over the next two years, with a one-in-four chance of that happening in the coming year. Those probabilities were steady compared with the last survey.

What hasn't remained steady is sentiment in financial markets. The Standard & Poor's 500 (.SPX) equities index appears to be on the cusp of a bear market, down close to 20% from its peak near the start of the year. read more

The U.S. economy, which contracted for the first time since 2020 in the January-March period, was expected to rebound to an annualized growth rate of 2.9% in the second quarter. But forecasts were in a significantly wide range of 1.0%-6.9%.

GDP growth was predicted to average 2.8% this year before moderating to only 2.1% and 1.9% in 2023 and 2024, respectively, down from the 3.3%, 2.2% and 2.0% predicted last month.

Reuters Poll - U.S. economy and Federal Reserve rate outlook

Forecasts for the unemployment rate remained optimistic, averaging 3.5% this year and next, before picking up to 3.7% in 2024.

But more than 80% of respondents to an additional question - 28 of 34 - said that over the coming two years it was more likely that unemployment would be higher than they currently expected than lower.

""The only realistic way to break the wage-price spiral is to push up the unemployment rate. If the Fed does not do this by accident, they will have to do it by design,"" said Philip Marey, senior U.S. strategist at Rabobank.

""A recession is the inevitable outcome.""

220,SP 500 drops into bear market territory as recession fears mount,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business)The S&P 500 fell into bear market territory Friday, slipping more than 20% from its record high and potentially ending the bull run that began in March 2020. 
The designation comes on the heels of six straight weekly losses for the index and follows months of precipitous market drops. The S&P 500 has long been considered the most accurate measure of the nation's stock performance.  
In the three years prior to this bear market, the index grew by 90%.
Downward momentum pushed the S&P 500 further in afternoon trading, down more than 2% for the day and 20.3% from its record-high close of 4,796.46 in early January. 
The index's slide highlights investors' increasingly dark economic outlook—one fueled by slowing economic and earnings growth, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve's subsequent monetary tightening. 
These conditions will likely continue until there's enough economic data to prove that inflation is cooling, said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. ""I don't think we're at quite peak freakout yet,"" she said. ""It might not be enough just to cross over into bear territory."" 
Young sees a slow burn ahead. ""I think we might have to stay [in a bear market] for a little while. I don't know that we're going to bounce back out of it very quickly.""
Friday's drop is also a bad omen for the economy as a whole. Only one bear market in the last 50 years, the market crash of 1987, was not accompanied by a recession. 
""For the majority of the bull market since the March 2020 low, investors have had reasons to buy the dips; and given this slowdown is looking more 'natural' and protracted, there is a heightened degree of fear and not knowing where to hide,"" wrote Charles Schwab analyst Kevin Gordon in a note. ""I don't think that discomfort leaves us anytime soon, especially given the fact that monetary and fiscal policy are no longer at investors' backs.""

There is a saying among market analysts that the Fed tends to tighten policy until something breaks, and many analysts believe that this downturn will continue on until the Fed finishes its current round of interest rate hikes. 
""With Federal Reserve policy still poised to accelerate the pace of tightening, with balance-sheet reduction entering the mix and inflation proving somewhat stubborn, investors are shifting their gaze toward potential for a growth scare if not an outright recession,"" wrote Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a note Monday. 
Morgan Stanley predicts a 27% chance of recession in the next 12 months, a probability that jumped from just 5% in March. 
Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile, doesn't foresee market cataclysm once the bear market officially begins. ""Volatility has been up a little bit, that has some effect on liquidity in some markets,"" he said during a Wall Street Journal interview Tuesday. ""Nonetheless, the markets are orderly, they are functioning."" 
There have been 17 S&P 500 bear markets (or near bear markets) since World War II with an average drop of nearly 30% and a duration of about a year, according to an analysis by LPL Research. 
The S&P 500 joins the Nasdaq Composite, which has lost more than 30% this year, in bear territory. The Dow, meanwhile, has fallen more than 5,900 points, or nearly 16%, this year.

222,Junk bonds are showing signs of liquidity strains as the SampP 500 heads into bear market territory,2022-05-20 15:17:00,"Concerns about the U.S. economy slipping into a recession isn’t the only thing nagging at corporate bond investors.

Trading in the riskier high-yield, or “junk-bond,” segment of corporate debt also has become a lot trickier in recent weeks, including as investors flee bond funds and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.67% teeters on officially entering another bear market.

Read: The S&P 500 is trading in bear-market territory. How far could it fall?

With trading activity serving as a key engine of functioning financial markets, big intraday gaps, in terms of where investors are willing to buy or sell bonds, can matter a lot, particularly as fears rise and liquidity drains from markets.

“Extreme risk aversion, defensive positioning, poor sentiment and funding concerns” all are gripping the U.S. high-yield bond market, said Oleg Melentyev’s strategy team at BofA Global, in a Friday client note.

Unlike transparency in stocks trading on exchanges, a huge swath of the U.S. bond market still trades with delayed transparency, making sentiment hard to gauge in real time.

To that end, Goldman Sachs analysts analyzed the divergence between where buyers and sellers have been willing to transact (see chart) in the U.S. junk-bond market over time. They found recent high-low intraday swings, or the “bid-ask spread,” nearing levels last seen amid in the wake of the March 2020 pandemic panic, in a weekly client note.

Liquidity pinch? Intraday volatility is picking up in junk bonds TRACE, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research

The Goldman team, led by Lotfi Karoui, pointed to a “notable uptick in intraday volatility, across the board,” including for the large iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, HYG, -0.04% where the high-low intraday range “suggests a higher hurdle for investors to deploy capital.”

Corporate bonds, from a total return perspective, have been deeply negative this year as the Federal Reserve works to fight high inflation by raising interest rates and cutting the size of its record $9 trillion balance sheet.

Until May, most of the negative performance was attributed to rates volatility, with the 10-year Treasury rate TMUBMUSD10Y, 2.785% topping 3.2% earlier this month, nearing a peak level last seen in 2018, or before the 2020 pandemic recession hit.

Bond yields and prices move in the opposite directions, sinking many longer dated corporate bonds by major U.S. companies to $70 prices, and lower, from around $100 to start the year.

What’s more, the Goldman team tracked $87 billion in notional U.S. high-yield bonds as trading at distressed levels, or a spread of at least 1,000 basis points above the risk-free Treasury rate, up from $24 billion as of July 2021, a post-financial crisis low for spreads in the sector.

On the recession-watch front, a key index for riskier CCC rated junk bonds and below crossed into distressed territory this week, last pegged at a spread of 1,061 basis points above Treasurys.

223,Strong household finances may mean Fed must to do more Kashkari,2022-05-19 21:49:55,"
May 19 (Reuters) - Minneapolis Federal Reserve Bank President Neel Kashkari on Thursday suggested that because household finances are in some cases in better shape than before the pandemic, the Fed may end up needing to raise rates further to bring inflation under control.

""Are these stronger balance sheets leading people to spend more, or be more confident, to just change their behavior, their spending patterns, and is that more sustainable - in which case maybe the Fed has to be even more aggressive,"" Kashkari told the Urban Institute.

That could mean difficult tradeoffs for the Federal Reserve, which is already raising rates faster than it has in decades to cool inflation running at a 40-year high.


Fed policymakers expect to get the target range for short-term interest rates, now at 0.75%-1%, a full percentage point higher by July, with more though potentially smaller rate hikes to follow.

The ""plausible"" hope, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week, is that heavier borrowing costs will drag down demand for labor enough to slow wage gains that might otherwise fuel inflation, but not so much that businesses resort to mass layoffs that could trigger a recession.

Kashkari said that because so much is beyond the Fed's control - supply chains, for instance, which in their currently tangled state are pushing upward in prices in ways that are only getting worse with China's COVID-19 lockdowns and Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

""We know we have to get inflation down; we are doing everything we can to achieve a 'soft landing,' but I'll be honest with you: I don't know the odds of us pulling that off,"" Kashkari said.

A rout in equities including an 18% drop in the S&P 500 Index since its Jan. 3 record close may help the Fed out, by reducing spending and therefore demand.

""The wealth effect is a real thing...those who have stocks have higher 401Ks, they feel more confident, they go out and spend more, when those things come down, it may change their behavior,"" Kashkari said. Though the Fed does not target stock prices, ""we do pay attention to that feedback.""

224,Growth scare permeates US stocks as estimated 5 trillion to 8 trillion of household wealth evaporates in five months,2022-05-20 15:08:00,"Amid a sea of red in U.S. stock markets on Friday, a fundamental shift in investors’ thinking is taking place, one which analysts describe as a “growth scare.”



A “growth scare” is characterized by a correction in anticipation of slowing economic growth, even if such a slowdown hasn’t yet been borne out by the data. Dow industrials DJIA, -0.55% are poised for their longest streak of weekly losses in 90 years and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.67% appeared to be on track to close in bear-market territory, as investors flocked to Treasurys and the dollar as safe havens of choice.

See: The S&P 500 is trading in bear-market territory. How far could it fall?



Friday’s broad-based selloff in equities punished every industry and every stock strategy —- from value and small-cap to growth, as well as the consumer-discretionary, energy, utilities, financial and tech sectors. Economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, -1.67% estimate that U.S. household wealth has fallen by $5 trillion to $8 trillion in 2022, driven largely by falling equity prices. And BofA Securities strategists ranked U.S. equities as this year’s worst-performing asset class, as well as the third-biggest loser among global stocks ahead of only Chinese and German equities, based on data through Wednesday.



Prior rounds of U.S. stock selloffs this year were largely driven by prospects of rising interest rates from the Federal Reserve, which is attempting to stomp out the highest inflation in four decades. While the risks of a recession or economic slowdown lingered in the backdrop, they hadn’t been brought to the fore. Many in financial markets have remained confident the U.S. can avoid a downturn, or speak of recession risks in terms of the next one to two years.



Data released in April shows the U.S. economy shrank 1.4% during the first quarter, mainly because of a record U.S. trade deficit, following a 6.9% surge in GDP in the final three months of 2021. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines a recession as a significant decline in activity lasting more than a few months.



But deteriorating stock values and financial conditions may have the potential to hasten the anticipated arrival of an economic downturn, according to some traders.



“For a good portion of this year, we saw a positive correlation between equities and bonds: that is, a selloff in equities and selloff on bonds,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Société Générale. “Now, we’re seeing a rally in bonds correspond to a selloff in equities. The subtle shift is that bonds are starting to act as safe haven, suggesting a growth scare and the potential for demand destruction that leads to lower growth.’’



“Clearly, this week’s price action in stocks stems from earnings guidance and forward-looking guidance on consumer spending, signaling the potential for a retrenchment,’’ she said via phone. Still, Rajappa said she isn’t seeing any “concrete evidence” of a recession in the data, though some slowdown in growth can’t be ruled out. She also foresees no serious risk of recession in the next 12 months.



As of Friday, there have been 59 negative earnings-per-share preannouncements issued by S&P 500 companies for the second quarter, and 32 that were positive, according to Refinitiv’s S&P 500 Earnings Scorecard. That compares with 55 that were negative and 28 which were positive a week ago.

Meanwhile, the flight to safety in government bonds was felt most acutely in the longest-term maturities, sending 10- TMUBMUSD10Y, 2.785% and 30-year rates TMUBMUSD30Y, 3.002% below 2.8% and 3% respectively. Yields drop when demand for bonds goes up.



The price action in bonds led to shrinking spreads between the 2-year TMUBMUSD02Y, 2.578% and 10-year rates, as well as between 5-year TMUBMUSD05Y, 2.806% and 30-year rates, which are seen as worrisome signs about the outlook. In addition, the 5-year rate traded above the 10-year yield, inverting that part of the curve.



Meanwhile, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.35% rose 0.5% to 103.24, not far from some of the highest levels in almost 20 years.



Over the past two years, since the pandemic began, U.S. household wealth has increased by $30 trillion, Michael Feroli, JPMorgan’s chief U.S. economist, said via phone Friday. In a sense, the market is “giving back a little bit from a period of strong gains and households are generally still probably sitting on unrealized gains over the past year,” he said.



JPMorgan isn’t yet forecasting a recession and expects U.S. growth to remain positive through next year, Feroli said. “But the risks are pretty elevated and over the next two years it’s a coin flip as to whether we go into a recession.”

KOENIGSWINTER, Germany, May 19 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said the G7 finance leaders on Thursday agreed to provide Ukraine the financial resources it needs in its struggle against Russia's invasion, and that policymakers are determined to meet their inflation targets.

Yellen, speaking to reporters after the first day of a G7 finance ministers and central bank governors' meeting here, declined to confirm an $18.4 billion figure pledged in the group's draft communique seen by Reuters. read more

The meeting wraps up on Friday.


Yellen said that funding pledges to Ukraine during the meeting exceeded the $15 billion that Kiev has estimated it needs over the next three months to make up for lost revenues as the war devastates its economy.

A $40 billion U.S. aid package under expected to be approved by the U.S. Senate this week would include $7.5 billion in new economic aid, while the European Commission pledged 9 billion euros for Ukraine, Yellen said. Other countries, including Canada and Germany, pledged additional amounts.

""The message was, 'We stand behind Ukraine. We're going to pull together with the resources that they need to get through this,'"" Yellen said.

She said that high global inflation was a significant topic, but none of the policymakers had said they were considering raising their targeted inflation rates.

""What was discussed was the critical importance of central banks taking the actions that are needed to show they are committed to the inflation targets that they've set,"" Yellen said.

Yellen said the officials felt that economic conditions had not changed "" so fundamentally, that it would be worth dislodging what we felt it become a stable anchored set of inflation expectations.""

She said that she still believed that the U.S. Federal Reserve could achieve a ""soft landing"" of the economy without causing a recession, but how Fed officials achieve this is up to them though it ""requires both skill and luck.""

Discussions about mechanisms to reduce Russia's revenues from oil exports to Europe were limited on Thursday, Yellen said, adding that there is a lot of interest in the concept.

U.S. officials have floated the idea of imposing tariffs on Russian oil to limit the amount of revenue that Moscow can collect while keeping Russian crude supplies on the market as EU officials pursue a phased embargo by year end. read more

Yellen said that a buyers' cartel that would not buy oil above certain prices could be successful if it is large enough.

""Nothing is really crystallized as an obvious strategy,"" she added.

227,The dip is your friend Why some advisers are telling young investors to buy stocks despite stagflation fears roiling markets,2022-05-20 14:17:00,"How low can stocks go? This question has made investors nervous, as they fear one bottom after another.

The answer: Pick a number. Some analysts say brace for further drops, others expect a bounce.

Wall Street is nervous at the prospect of stagflation — the double-edged sword of prolonged inflation and high unemployment — as the Federal Reserve attempts to combat inflation by raising interest rates without pushing the economy into recession.

Anh Tran, managing partner at Orange, Calif.-based SageMint Wealth, has some advice for young investors who have time before they retire: “These are the times that we should take advantage of the market’s volatility and continue to invest.”

She was speaking at CNBC’s “Own Your Money Before it Owns You” event on Thursday.

Why? Generation Z and millennial investors have 25 to 30 years or so recover from another bottom.

“A dip is your best friend, so buy the dip, take advantage of the fact that prices are low right now and don’t try to time the market,” added Paula Pant, host of the podcast “Afford Anything,” also at the event.

“‘These are the times that we should take advantage of the market’s volatility and continue to invest.’” — Anh Tran of SageMint Wealth

Buying the dip or “BTD” is not always as simple or smart a move as it might appear, as Jon Burckett-St. Laurent, a senior portfolio manager at Exencial Wealth Advisors, wrote on MarketWatch in April.

With CPI hovering at 40-year highs — hitting 8.3% in April — he said central banks may not be so eager to intervene with aggressive rate cuts or keep extra money flowing with bond purchases via so-called “quantitative easing,” especially in the event that economic growth slows significantly.

“The next problem with BTD is that a realistic strategy requires more details than ‘buy when the price falls,’” he wrote. “Some questions to consider: What constitutes a dip? What money are we using to buy? When do we sell?”

Instead, Burckett-St. Laurent recommends what he calls a “tactical rebalance” to, for example, 80% stocks and 20% bonds and, once the market has recovered and fundamentals look more secure, move back to 60% stocks and 40% bonds.

He also suggests waiting for blood on the streets. “If stocks are down 50%, it may constitute a sentiment-driven overreaction,” he added. A decline of 3%, 5% or even10%, is not exactly a “generational buying opportunity,” he added.

“‘Some questions to consider: What constitutes a dip? What money are we using to buy? When do we sell?’” — Jon Burckett-St. Laurent, a senior portfolio manager at Exencial Wealth Advisors

Still, a recent survey by personal-finance site Bankrate shows 43% of investors ages 18 to 25 said they’re ready to increase their investments. More than a quarter, 27%, were millennials ages 26 to 41.

But only14% of investors ages 41 to 57, the so-called Gen X demographic. And just 8% of baby boomers, ages 58 to 76, said they were likely to invest more in the market this year. Some 22% said they’d be investing less.

Even those younger investors may be less confident now about buying the dip. The new survey was fielded a month ago — before Wednesday’s stock-market rout in the face of inflation jitters.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.51% , the S&P 500 SPX, -0.62% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.09% all slid into the red again on Friday, after briefly holding onto positive territory earlier in the day.

The Dow and S&P 500 closed Thursday at their lowest since March 2021. The Dow is on track for a 2.3% weekly fall, which would be its eighth straight and the longest since 1932, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

228,Oil rebounds from two days of losses in volatile trade,2022-05-19 19:06:57,"
Summary Europe still weighing ban on imports from Russia

U.S. dollar backs off recent gains, down 1%

NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices rebounded from two days of losses in a volatile session on Thursday, bolstered by weakness in the dollar and expectations that China could ease some lockdown restrictions that could boost demand.

Crude benchmarks continued their spate of wild swings, with both Brent and U.S. crude rising by nearly $5 a barrel in the span of a few hours, recovering from losses earlier in the week.

""The market has been extremely volatile,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. ""The market is reacting to all sorts of different headlines hour to hour, and the movement in oil markets on a day-by-day basis getting even more exaggerated.""


Brent crude futures for July settled at $112.04, a gain of $2.93 a barrel, or 2.7%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for June settled up $2.62, or 2.4%, to $112.21 a barrel.

In China, investors are closely watching plans to ease coronavirus curbs from June 1 in the most populous city of Shanghai, which could lead to a rebound in oil demand from the world's top crude importer.

Oil markets also rebounded as the dollar weakened. The broad dollar index was down 1% on the day after recent gains. Oil benchmarks often move inversely to the dollar as most global crude transactions are handled in dollars, so a rising greenback makes crude more expensive for big importers.

Crude gains have been limited, however, with the Brent and U.S. benchmarks trading in a range due to the uncertain path of demand. Investors, worried about rising inflation and more aggressive action from central banks, have been reducing exposure to riskier assets.

""Brent seems pinned above $100 but I think the recession risk and all of the concerns about Chinese demand are limiting the upside and will continue to do that,"" said Bill Farren-Price, head of oil and gas macro research at Enverus in London.

The looming possibility of a European Union ban on Russian oil imports has been supporting prices. This month the EU proposed a new package of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation.""

That would include a total ban on oil imports in six months' time, but the measures have not yet been adopted, with Hungary among the most vocal critics of the plan. read more

229,Lufthansa CEO says Boeing will get back to its feet,2022-05-19 18:16:37,"
Earlier this month, Lufthansa said it would buy 10 cargo planes including seven of the 777X version, also known as 777-8F, and boosted its order for Boeing 787s.

""Boeing as a symbol of America will get back to its feet,"" Spohr said at a luncheon speech in Washington. He added to airline officials in attendance, ""It's a good time to negotiate prices with Boeing right now.""


Spohr said Lufthansa's order came ""at a time that Boeing is obviously going through some trouble.""

Noting that he has been asked why Lufthansa ""so blindly believe in Boeing"" while others have canceled orders or given up on delivery dates, Spohr said his answer was that the airline's employees ""believe in Boeing as a company."" He compared Boeing to the United States' getting back on its feet after various crises in past decades.

Boeing has faced delays in some programs and concerns about whether it will win regulatory approval for the 737-MAX 10 ahead of a key December deadline.

Last month, Boeing announced it was halting 777X production through 2023 due to a fresh delay in its entry into service after certification problems and weak demand. Boeing confirmed a delay in handing over the first 777X jet to 2025, from the previous target of late 2023. read more

Lufthansa is seeing extremely strong summer travel demand. Spohr said the carrier's most expensive ticket for sale now is a $24,000 first-class round-trip ticket San Francisco-to-Frankfurt. ""And we're sold out,"" Spohr said.

He said the airline is not giving a full-year outlook because of the uncertainty of fuel prices, inflation and the potential of recession. ""There are many more question marks for the rest of the year,"" Spohr said.

230,Cheer Up Even a Bear Market Has a Silver Lining,2022-05-20 14:16:00,"Rising interest rates, sky-high inflation, lackluster economic growth, pressure on corporate profit margins: It isn’t hard to come up with reasons to be bearish on the stock market right now—or see the S&P 500 down 20% and be full of doom and gloom.

But there are reasons to be optimistic, too. As the S&P 500 officially enters a bear market and wraps up its seventh straight week of losses, now seems like a good time to bring them up.

For starters, a recession isn’t a done deal. Sky-high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish moves to bring it down, plus the long-running supply chain and Covid-19 drags on growth, are the best known forces that risk tipping the U.S. and global economies into contraction. On the other hand, Americans have significant savings from the past two years that could help cushion the blow of those rising prices, and an ultra-strong job market is another positive for households. And while interest rates are certainly going up, they remain low by historical standards and won’t rise above neutral for some time.

“U.S. economic surprises remain in positive territory,” wrote RBC Capital Markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina. “High frequency economic indicators like dining, flying, back to work, and same store sales remain stable. Freight rates have come down sharply from their highs. Inflation expectations are retreating.”

That hasn’t stopped stocks from largely pricing in a recession since the start of the year. The S&P 500 was down 1.5% on Friday afternoon, stretching its loss to more than 20% from the index’s Jan. 3 record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 15%, and the Nasdaq Composite has tumbled 30%.

“Historically, the S&P 500 has fallen an average of 29% around recession (median of 24%),” wrote Truist co-CIO Keith Lerner on Friday. “With the S&P 500 currently showing a peak-to-trough decline of almost 19%, the market is effectively already pricing in a 60%-75% chance of recession based on the average and median.”

That means typical downside of another 7% to 13% if a recession does in fact arrive, according to Lerner. If it doesn’t, there’s a rally on its way.

“When equity market odds of recession have moved to current levels, 12-month forward returns have been binary,” wrote Keith Parker, head of U.S. equity strategy at UBS, earlier this week. “The S&P 500 fell by -9% on average when a recession materialized but rallied +12% if it did not.”

The entirety of the correction this year has been in the market’s valuation multiple, with analysts not pricing an earnings recession into their models. That could be a miscalculation, and suggest that estimates will have to decline. Or it could mean that the individual-company view is rosier than the macro picture.

“At face value, this year’s decline in the S&P 500 looks a bit unusual,” ​​wrote Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics. “Previous large falls, such as in 2007-09 and 2020, have often come alongside big downward revisions to earnings expectations …By contrast, aggregate earnings forecasts for S&P 500 companies have been revised up this year, even as stock prices have tumbled.”

The S&P 500 now trades for less than 17 times its expected earnings over the next four quarters, down from nearly 22 times at the beginning of the year. The multiple is elevated due to the pricey Big Tech stocks at the top of the index, which is weighted by market value. The equal-weight S&P 500, meanwhile, trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just over 14 times.

The optimist’s view is that’s a reasonable valuation that sets the market up for a potential rebound. Measures of investor sentiment, fund flows, and positioning have become significantly more bearish and negative as the market has sold off. Those contrarian indicators historically have been followed by rebounds. The past seven weeks have been painful, but the upshot is a much more attractive starting point for stock investors today.

The entry into a bear market has been the pivot point in the past. The S&P 500 has been higher one month later 83% of the time since 1950, according to Dow Jones Market Data, with an average gain of 3.7%. And a year after entering a bear market, returns have been positive 75% of the time—averaging 17%.

“Equities stand to recover if a recession doesn’t come through, given already substantial multiple de-rating, reduced positioning, and downbeat sentiment,” wrote Marko Kolanovic, J.P. Morgan’s chief global markets strategist.

It’s impossible to call a trough in real time, and a near-term bounce may be followed by further declines. But it isn’t all bad out there. And with stocks pricing in a near worst-case scenario, it wouldn’t take a lot of good news to get the market rising again.

231,European shares lower as retailers food and beverage stocks lead falls,2022-05-19 16:11:18,"
Summary

Summary Companies Dismal Target, Walmart results bring growth worries

Nestle, Diageo, Unilever slip between 2.7% and 4.5%

HomeServe jumps on $5 billion offer

Valneva jumps on EU's nod for COVID-19 vaccine

May 19 (Reuters) - European shares slumped 1.5% on Thursday, stretching declines to the second straight session, as dismal results from big U.S. retailers underlined the hit from surging inflation on the world's biggest economy.

Tracking U.S. peers, European retailers (.SXRP) fell nearly 2% and were the biggest drags on the pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX), which extended declines after a 1% slide on Wednesday.

Losses were broad based, with all major sub-sectors trading in the red.


U.S. stock futures pointed to a fresh sell-off after Target Corp's (TGT.N) quarterly profit halved and Walmart (WMT.N) cut its profit view as they struggle with rising fuel and freight costs, while consumers shift their spending away from big-ticket purchases to essentials. read more

European retailers such as Tesco (TSCO.L) and Sainsbury (SBRY.L) had also warned last month of a hit to full-year profits from rising prices. read more

Nestle (NESN.S), Tesco, Diageo (DGE.L) and Unilever (ULVR.L) fell between 4.5% and 5.5% on Thursday.

""The fact that earnings are being compressed for mid-to-lower tier consumers just tells you inflation is having an impact ... on Europe probably more so than the U.S. because wage expectations are not as good,"" said Sebastien Galy, senior macro strategist at Nordea Asset Management.

""It's reviving the stories of stagflation, particularly so in the euro zone.""

Along with the ongoing stimulus reduction by central banks and concerns about the fallout from the Ukraine war, investors fled to the safety of bonds.

""The end of earnings season might provide some brief respite from all the negativity, but with more high inflation readings and interest rate hikes to come stocks are going to suffer a lot more bad news,"" said Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at online trading platform IG.

The STOXX 600 is down 12% for the year as China's COVID-19 worries added to global recession fears. But as cases drop, hopes of recovery have offered some respite to investors.

Among other stocks, HomeServe (HSV.L) rallied 10.2% after Canada's Brookfield Asset Management (BAMa.TO) said it had agreed to buy the British home repair services firm for 4.08 billion pounds ($5.04 billion). read more

Britain's Royal Mail (RMG.L) fell 12.4% after the company's 2021-22 profit just missed market expectations. read more

First-quarter earnings for companies listed on STOXX 600 are expected to increase 41.5% from a year ago, according to Refinitiv data. As of Tuesday, 68.4% of results from companies had exceeded market expectations. In a typical quarter 52% beat profit estimates.

232,Why Is the Stock Market Down Today Dow Slides SP Dips Into Bear Market,2022-05-20 14:11:00,"The stock market’s early rally didn’t last long on Friday, as the S&P 500 entered bear market territory, down more than 20% from its January record high.

In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 412 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 was down 1.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.1%. All three indexes began the day with gains. If the S&P 500 closes below 3837, it would officially be in a bear market. It touched 3810 this afternoon.

The Dow was on pace to post an eighth straight weekly loss, the worst losing streak since 1932. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were on track to fall for seven straight weeks, their worst showing since 2001.

Much of the decline in investor confidence this week stems from lackluster retail earnings, which has raised fears that a consumer-led downturn is approaching, Canaccord Genuity analyst Martin Roberge noted, as both revenues and margins could come under pressure at these companies in the coming quarters. “[T]he surge in goods prices and inflation translates into demand destruction as consumers have little choice but to shift their spending patterns toward essentials,” he wrote.

That said, Roberge pointed to some silver linings, including the decline in U.S. bond yields, a leveling off for the U.S. dollar and commodities, and partial reopening in China. “These green shoots should allow markets to enjoy the typical relief rallies seen around the -20% correction mark,” Roberge wrote—but warned that if they don’t, a -30% correction could be next.

Speaking of China, sentiment was boosted earlier Friday after the People’s Bank of China lowered the key five-year prime loan rate for the second time this year. The move to 4.45% to 4.6% was the largest cut on record.

It’s the kind of narrative-changing move the market needed following Wednesday’s rout, which wiped out some $1.5 trillion in market value, but it hasn’t been enough to soothe investors’ jangled nerves.

The Federal Reserve, of course, is raising interest rates and draining money from the economy as it tries to get inflation under control. That’s raised the risk of a recession in the coming months if the Fed tightens too much. Still, there were signs on Thursday that the market was wrestling with how much more it needed to fall to reflect those risks.

“Historically, the S&P 500 has fallen an average of 29% around recession (median of 24%). The market is effectively already pricing in a 60%-75% chance of recession based on the average and median,” wrote Truist Advisory Services Chief Market Strategist Keith Lerner. That said, he noted that given the market’s recent decline and “current oversold backdrop, we would not be sellers at these levels for investors that are aligned with their longer-term allocation targets.”

Still, there could be some small hope to end the week. “The one silver lining from the selling of the past two days was that we managed to close well off from last week’s lows, suggesting a general reluctance to become too bearish too quickly,” said Michael Hewson, an analyst at broker CMC Markets.

Cold comfort, that.

Overseas, the pan-European Stoxx 600 gained 0.7% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rallied 3%.

Here are some stocks on the move Friday:

Palo Alto Networks (ticker: PANW) shot up 7.7% after the cybersecurity company reported stronger-than-expected results and raised its guidance. It saw sales rise 29% from a year earlier to $1.4 billion in the last quarter and expects revenue to touch as high as $1.55 billion in the current quarter.

Ross Stores (ROST) tumbled 23.9% after its earnings and sales missed analyst forecasts. Its guidance was dreadful as well.

Deere (DE) has fallen 13.8% despite reporting better-than-expected earnings.

Air France-KLM (AF.France) rose 1.1% in Paris trading, after the airline group entered into discussions with private equity giant Apollo Global Management (APO) over a €500 million ($530 million) capital injection. Apollo shares rose less than 0.5% in the U.S. premarket.

Cie. Financière Richemont (CFR.Switzerland) tumbled 13.1% in Zurich trading, after the luxury group behind brands including Cartier and Montblanc reported operating profit short of analysts’ expectations. The company’s chief financial officer suggested supply-chain disruptions weren’t over and that stagflation—slowing growth and inflation—represents the largest headwind.

Target's earnings showed consumers spending more on food and household essentials instead of high-margin discretionary items, while Walmart showed shoppers had moved to buy lower-margin basics. read more

On Tuesday, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell pledged the U.S. central bank would raise interest rates as high as needed to kill the surge in inflation. read more

The S&P 500 (.SPX) was last down 0.2%, leaving it down 18% year-to-date and 18.6% below its Jan. 3 record close, after closing down 4% in Wednesday's broad sell-off.

""Retailers are starting to reveal the impact of eroding consumer purchasing power,"" Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, said on Wednesday after his firm forecast a mild recession around year-end into early 2023. read more

""The consumer's ability to spend is eroding at a faster pace than it was a month or two ago. We think that pace is going to accelerate further,"" he said.

The S&P 500's consumer discretionary index (.SPLRCD) bounced back slightly, last up 0.9% after losing 6.6% on Wednesday in its deepest one-day sell-off since March 2020 and was still off more than 30% year-to-date, putting it on track for its weakest year since 2008.

Cantor Fitzgerald said it was unwinding its expectation for a short-term bounce in equities and that if there is a lift, it would likely be shallow and ""not worth playing.""

""The (Wal-Mart/Target) numbers are very concerning as they show the consumer is reducing discretionary purchases while company margins return to pre-pandemic levels,"" said Eric Johnston, head of equity derivatives and cross asset at Cantor Fitzgerald.

While investors have been worried for some time about inflation, the latest results pile on worries about the impact of inflation on the consumer, said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial.

However, the sell-off came the day after data showing U.S. retail sales rose strongly in April as consumers bought more motor vehicles amid supply improvements along with increased spending at restaurants despite high inflation, souring consumer sentiment and rising interest rates. read more

Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer at Cornerstone Wealth, said the narrative was ""shifting from inflation scare to recession scare.""

Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services, said retailer results appeared to be potentially ""one more indication of perhaps a slowdown in the economy.”

“I just wonder if people are starting to really get pinched by fuel costs – both businesses as well as consumers. ... When you are paying north of $5 for a gallon of gas, that’s a hammer and that’s a hammer on everybody,” Carlson said.

234,Stockmarket rout pushes SampP 500 into bearmarket territory Dow falls 500 points,2022-05-20 13:45:00,"U.S. stocks were sharply lower Friday afternoon, with the S&P 500 index slipping into bear-market territory and the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for its longest string of weekly losses in 90 years.

On Thursday, the Dow industrials and S&P 500 booked their lowest closes since March 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. For the week, the Dow is heading for a 4.6% drop, while the S&P 500 is on pace to fall 5% and the Nasdaq is poised to tumble 6.2%, FactSet data show, at last check.

Wall Street initially took a cue from a strong Asian session, where the Hong Kong Hang Seng HSI, +2.96% ended about 3% higher and the China CSI 300 index 000300, +1.95% rose nearly 2%, but early gains Friday in the U.S. stock market proved fragile.

“Stocks remain on a shaky footing. Investors’ list of worries grows ever larger,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with City Index and Forex.com, in a note.

”Inflation. Interest-rate hikes. Low economic growth. Stagflation. Recession. Perhaps most importantly for stocks, the Fed is not there to provide cushion, like before,” he wrote.

Stocks were initially buoyed after the People’s Bank of China on Friday cut in its rate on five-year loans, aimed at shoring up weak housing sales by reducing mortgage costs. The country has been battling COVID outbreaks, with lockdowns in industrial hubs such as Shanghai blamed for weak factory and consumer activity data in April.

But analysts said the move also underlined concerns.

“Where the rest of the world is thinking of raising rates because of inflation, they’re cutting rates in order to help the economy,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for online brokerage firm tastytrade Inc., in a phone interview. “I think that’s a little bit of a warning sign,” as U.S. companies that benefit from demand in China may be hurt by a slowing Chinese economy as well as supply-chain disruptions linked to the country’s lockdowns, he said.

The S&P 500 traded into bear-market territory Friday afternoon, with all of its 11 sectors down, FactSet data show, at last check.

Friday is the final day of trading before the expiration of options tied to stocks and exchange-traded funds, which is seen potentially contributing to volatility ahead of the end of the session.

Major U.S. stock indexes remain on track for another week of losses, with investors worried about whether soaring inflation can be brought under control by the Federal Reserve without derailing the economy.

The Dow is heading for its eighth straight weekly decline, which would be its longest since April 1932, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were on track for a seventh straight weekly fall, the longest streak for each since 2001.

Major retailers this week, such as Walmart WMTand Target TGT reported disappointing profits, against a backdrop of rising expenses and inflation.

Mark Hulbert: Here’s the real reason the stock market is coming unglued — and it isn’t because of weak earnings

This past week has shown that the risk of economic downturn, fears that high inflation is cutting into corporate performance and rising borrowing costs remain the major worry for markets, particularly after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank “won’t hesitate” to lift rates beyond neutral to curb high inflation, according to Christian Stocker, lead equity sector strategist at UniCredit Bank in Munich.

“In this environment, investor sentiment is fickle and markets are likely to remain choppy to both sides until there is greater clarity in terms of recession, rates, and geopolitical risks,” Stocker said.

The U.S. economic data calendar is empty for Friday, but next week will bring another round of inflation data, personal consumption expenditure prices excluding food and energy.

235,Is JPMorgan slipping Analysts will be asking CEO Dimon at conference,2022-05-19 10:06:45,"
NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - Concerned that JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) might be starting to lose its profit advantage over competitors, analysts and investors are lining up questions for long-time CEO Jamie Dimon and other executives appearing at the bank's first investor conference in two years on Monday.

The meeting was scheduled after JPMorgan stunned investors in January by revealing that 2022 costs would increase by $6 billion, or 8%, without forecasting fully offsetting revenue gains or persuasive arguments that new business investments will eventually pay off. read more

In April the bank again surprised investors by how much excess capital had been lost in the first quarter to unrealized losses on its bond portfolio and market risk even as it anticipated higher capital requirements from regulators. read more


JPMorgan stock, which has outperformed other big banks for more than a decade, has lost 24% this year through Wednesday, compared with a 20% drop of bank stocks in the S&P 500. (.SPXBK)

Some analysts worry JPMorgan, the country's largest lender, has grown complacent.

""To what degree has JPM rested on its laurels?"" Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo asked in a note this week.

Still, JPMorgan remains ""best-in-class,"" Mayo said. It leads in capital markets, investment banking, credit cards and consumer banking and has produced superior growth, operating efficiency and returns since the financial crisis. Its shares still trade at premium valuations to other banks.

Monday's meeting in New York is scheduled to start with the release at 6 a.m. EDT of slides that will accompany executive presentations, which will run from 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. EDT.

Analysts and investors will quickly search for any changes in the bank's outlook for net interest and fee income, expenses and profitability, as shown by return on tangible common equity.

In the month following 11 of the past 15 investor meetings its shares have outperformed other bank stocks, according to analyst Jason Goldberg of Barclays.

Its shares could rally if the bank increases its outlook for net interest income, says it can meet its profitability target more quickly or demonstrates that the new spending will pay off, Goldberg added.

Executives' presentations are expected to broadly track themes that Dimon, 66, has been emphasizing in recent public appearances and his April investor letter. read more

On costs, Dimon has said that JPMorgan will not try to please short-term investors by curtailing spending on necessary business investments. It must spend to compete against giant technology companies as well as fintechs and other financial firms, he has said.

On capital, Dimon may discuss what he said in his April letter is a dilemma when managing capital for a bank of JPMorgan's size and complexity: whether it should restrict its growth to hold down its capital requirements to achieve a higher return on equity, or accept a lower return in order to grow.

Investors are also likely to push Dimon on recession risks and inflation, as well as market volatility, loan growth and borrower defaults.

236,Opinion The US isnt headed for recession Nor will it be consumed by inflationary fires,2022-05-20 12:09:00,"“Some say the world will end in fire,” goes a famous Robert Frost line. “And some say in ice.”

If ever poetry could explain the stock market, this may come closest to capturing the sour mood that’s about to deliver a seventh consecutive week of stock-market losses.

With half the world’s investors apparently spooked by rising prices and the other half worried about growth, there are precious few buyers standing ready to balance out the general gloom.

But while there’s almost nowhere to hide when stagnation and inflation collide, this economic adjustment doesn’t feel like the start of a lingering illness. Rather it has the makings of a temporary shock that – soon enough — will restore the economy to balance.

That hardly mitigates the pain of the last six months of stock-market SPX, -0.66% declines, but it doesn’t justify the grim warnings of a looming U.S. recession. Recent price spikes in food and energy have already started to sour consumer sentiment, making the Fed’s task of price stabilization much easier to achieve. Growth will surely slow from here, but it’s hard to imagine a sharp collapse in demand given that consumers and companies have rarely been this flush.

Disorientating

These are clearly disorienting times. After nearly four decades of declining inflation and mostly solid growth, few active investors have ever grappled with markets feeling the heat of such sharp price hikes. Other than the 2008 financial crisis, which is already 14 years ago, the shivering prospects of recession have been relatively brief.

It has been a long time since analysts choosing assumptions for their valuation models have faced such a quandary. Should they use the Fed’s long-term inflation forecast of 2%, when they know their car just took $60 of gasoline? Can the Fed really ease growth to its projection 2.0%-2.9% for next year executing what Chair Jerome Powell now calls a “softish landing.”?

Stocks have been falling because in this environment no one gets through an investment committee with sunny assumptions about either inflation or growth. Meanwhile, uncertainty around both sets of numbers means it’s hard to tell what’s cheap. When rates were falling reliably and earnings were predictable, it was easy to talk yourself into price-to-earnings multiples in the high-20s. Today, investors aren’t sure stocks are bargains now that the S&P 500 multiples are now in the high teens.

But the case for America consumed by inflationary fires just doesn’t stand scrutiny. First, U.S. consumer price inflation seems to have peaked last week, even if wage pressures still need watching. Second, if higher prices don’t force many summer travel cancellations, they will calm this year’s Christmas shopping frenzy even if supply chains aren’t fully back to normal. Third, and most important, long-term rates are holding steady even as short rates rise, suggesting markets believe the Fed will succeed in stabilizing prices.

It’s technically possible the U.S. will tip into a recession within the next year, but a lot more would have to go wrong. Amid the dark headlines, it’s easy to forget that unemployment has reached near-historic lows and workers quitting their jobs in search of something better near historic highs. Corporate capital expenditure is up as well as firms invest in more advanced technology and more resilient supply chains.

Plenty of risks

Just how much damage is done as the economy “downshifts” is hard to predict. If the Fed is to fulfill one mandate to deliver “stable prices,” it will have to settle for a lower level for its other mandate of “maximum employment.” Loan defaults will have to rise from their own historically low levels. The housing market will have to stabilize.

Meanwhile, there are plenty of risks beyond American shores that could weigh on the U.S. economy. Europeans now face dramatically higher energy prices as they tighten sanctions on Russia. Food-importing countries face much higher prices for wheat and fertilizer, too. In China, COVID restrictions undermined seen industrial production declined a shocking 2.9% last month threatening further disruption to global supply chains.

Many of these risks have appeared suddenly and unexpectedly, creating stiff headwinds for U.S. stocks. The irony is that the relatively sharp price shocks from supply-chain disruptions and commodity price spikes make it more likely that red-hot demand will cool on its own. Inflation rates may find a new range above pre-pandemic levels, but they will be lower and more predictable than they are today.

There may be more fire and there may be more ice. But the world will not end.

237,By Dragons Rock worlds policymakers plot how to slay stagflation,2022-05-19 09:51:49,"
KOENIGSWINTER, Germany, May 19 (Reuters) - The world's top central bankers and finance ministers gathering near Germany's Dragon's Rock on Thursday have their own beast to slay: stagflation.

The Group of Seven financial leaders are meeting as the war in Ukraine adds fuel to a surge in the cost of raw materials while new pandemic-related restrictions in China have slowed down global trade, raising the spectre of a sustained period of high inflation and economic stagnation.

""We will have to discuss what we can do together in our respective areas of responsibility to avoid stagflation scenarios,"" German finance minister Christian Lindner told reporters as leaders arrived for the two-day meeting.


The palatial hotel in Koenignswinter where the event is hosted overlooks the Drachenfels, or Dragon's Rock, where the hero of the medieval Nibelung legend, Siegfried, is supposed to have slain a dragon that lived in a mountain cave.

Every bit as lethal and intractable as a mythological monster, stagflation had no easy fix: stimulate the economy and prices will run away even faster, close the money taps and you will choke off economic growth.

After underestimating inflation for most of last year, most central bankers from the United States to Europe and Australia were now single-mindedly focused on curbing prices that have been rising at the fastest pace in decades.

The Federal Reserve, the world's most influential central bank due to the dollar's dominance on global financial markets, has pledged to raise interest rates as high as needed even if that could end up costing some people their jobs. read more

Even the European Central Bank, which had until recently all but ruled out rate hikes, was now moving towards the first increase in more than a decade - probably the first of several. read more

But finance ministers are worried that the economy would deteriorate further as sanctions against Russia make importing raw materials from oil to wheat more expensive - straining household budgets just as borrowing costs also rise.

""The economic outlook globally is challenging, and uncertain, and higher food and energy prices are having stagflationary effects, namely, depressing output and spending and raising inflation all around the world,"" U.S. Treasury secretary Janet Yellen said in Bonn on Wednesday.

She has argued that the United States should remove tariffs of up to 25% on some Chinese imports that are not strategic, such as bicycles, lawn mowers and T-shirts - a move that would make them cheaper for U.S. consumers and offering much-needed relief. read more

Other governments such as Italy's and Germany's have cut the tax on fuel while France has capped the price of natural gas and electricity to soften the economic impact of soaring energy costs.

Yellen had previously avoided mentioning ""stagflation"" - a term associated with 1970s inflation spikes and sluggish growth - when describing the U.S. economy, which has strong momentum from the COVID-19 recovery and strong labour market.

A generation ago, it took Fed's chair Paul Volcker a brutal series of rate hikes and a recession to break the back of inflation, ushering an era of stable prices and steadier economic growth.

Legendary hero Siegfried was also said to have gained near immortality after bathing in the dragon's blood.

But an economic bloodbath is what today's policymakers are still hoping to avoid.

238,HP Enterprise and Pure Storage Slide as Analyst Sees Potential Business Slowdown,2022-05-20 11:16:00,"Seeing myriad risks ahead for enterprise hardware spending, Bank of America Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan cut his ratings on both HP Enterprise and Pure Storage to Neutral from Buy, sending both stocks lower on Friday.

Mohan points to four risks, none of which should be a particular surprise. His list includes a potential U.S. recession, a slowdown in demand in Europe related to the Russia-Ukraine war, Covid-related shutdowns in China, and continued component shortages and supply-chain disruptions.

Earlier this week, Cisco Systems (ticker: CSCO) posted weaker-than-expected results and guidance for its April quarter, due to a combination of suspended business in Russia and a shortage of power supplies and other parts, largely due to ongoing Covid-19 restrictions in Shanghai.

Both HP Enterprise ( HPE ) and Pure Storage (PSTG) are scheduled to report April quarter results after the close of trading on June 1.

For HP Enterprise, which provides networking and computing hardware, Mohan cuts his target price to $16, from $19. The analyst thinks there is a risk that HP will pare its earnings outlook, and he cites worries about order deceleration, in particular in the company’s high-performance computing segment, which includes the old Cray supercomputer business. HP Enterprise has projected profit for the April quarter of between 41 and 49 cents a share on a non-GAAP basis. For the fiscal year ending in October, HPE has projected revenue adjusted for currency to be up 3% to 4%, with non-GAAP profit of between $2.03 and $2.17 a share.

Regarding Pure Storage, which provides memory systems and services to enterprise customers, Mohan writes that he is “cautious on demand trajectory over the next several quarters,” after checks with resellers found that “confidence in storage spending is turning lower.” Pure has projected revenue for the fiscal first quarter ended in April of $520 million; the company sees full-year revenue of $2.6 billion. Mohan trims his target price on Pure shares to $27, from $34.

Mohan also trims his target price on NetApp (NTAP) to $75, from $96, while keeping the Neutral rating. The analyst maintains his Buy rating on Dell Technologies (DELL) shares, but trims his target price to $65, from $76.

Both HP Enterprise and Pure Storage shares are down more than 7% on Friday.

Barron’s has approached both companies for comment.

239,The capitulation model for biotech is a Category 5 storm the same as energy in 2020  why contrarians say the sector is a buy,2022-05-20 10:34:00,"If you want to know how much investors hate the biotech sector right now, consider this simple statistic: More than 25% of small biotech companies have stock-market capitalizations that are smaller than how much they have in cash.

“The market is saying a quarter of these companies are literally worth nothing,” says Jefferies biotech analyst Michael Yee, who recently published this insight.

That’s remarkable. That 25% is the highest in 15 years — higher than even during the agonizingly long bear market of the 2008 financial crisis.

Back then, 18% traded below cash. From 2010 to 2020, the number bounced between 3% and 11%, according to Yee and his team. He’s referring to small- and medium-cap (smidcap) companies, those with a market cap of less than $5 billion. These are the ones that tend to have no earnings and have early-stage therapies in testing.

“This is the worst drawdown we have seen in our careers,” says biotech analyst Charmaine Chan with the Cambiar Opportunity Fund CAMOX, -0.32% . “No one has seen anything worse unless they have done this for over 20 years.”

For contrarians, this kind of extreme signal suggest only one thing. The sector is a buy. While it’s tough to find any biotech experts who are bullish on the group (even Yee is cautious), I’m not the only one looking at this as a contrarian opportunity.

Category 5 storm in biotech

The macro analyst Larry McDonald at The Bear Traps report has a similar view. To spot contrarian buy signals, McDonald tracks a collection of capitulation markers he developed during the 2008 crisis. They tell him when a sector is so despised that it is worth buying, in the contrarian sense. It’s a “blood in the streets” indicator, to borrow from the old Wall Street adage that says we should buy stocks when there’s blood in the streets. His capitulation gauge tracks several technical signals, among other things.

“The capitulation model for biotech is a Category 5 storm, the same as energy in 2020,” says McDonald. “The risk-reward is fantastic, at least for a countertrend bounce.”

Look at how the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production exchange-traded fund XOP, +0.14% is up over 170% from its 2020 midpoint.

McDonald suggests the SPDR S&P Biotech XBI, +0.45% and iShares Biotechnology IBB, +0.01% ETFs. I suggest six individual stocks below with help from Yee and Chan. McDonald thinks the XBI could go up 20% to $83 in a shorter-term countertrend rally, and possibly rise 30% to $90 or more a year from now. Those targets are the 50- and 100-day moving averages.

Biotech experts disagree

People who know the space better than myself and McDonald aren’t on board. Yee, who has been cautious since last summer ahead of the big decline, thinks biotech will remain challenged for the year. “It will take a lot of time to heal these wounds,” he says.

There’s nothing broken about the underlying science being developed in biotech, or the prospects for innovation, he says. It’s just that stocks can stay cheap for longer than you expect. “Why would someone wake up tomorrow and say ‘I need to buy all the smidcap biotech stocks down 50%?’ It’s always tough to be the first one in the swamp.”

“I think it a little bit too early to be bullish,” agrees Cambiar’s Chan. “You need catalysts to change the narrative.”

Look for progress on these fronts.

1. More biotech mergers and acquisitions

“M&A would change the narrative, but it’s not happening,” says Chan.

There is a good case for it, though. “Big pharma has so much cash they could basically buy the whole smidcap universe,” notes Yee. Their cumulative cash balance has now risen to more than $300 billion.

“The CFOs of big pharma are looking at this carnage, and they are just licking their chops,” says McDonald. “You are probably going to see substantially more transactions down here.”

Yee expects M&A to pick up gradually, but he’s less optimistic than McDonald. “M&A is tough when markets are falling fast,” he says.

2. The FDA gets its act together

From baby formula shortages to drug-approval delays and terribly mixed signals on approval paths, the Food & Drug Administration has been a big source of problems and confusion for everyone from parents to biotech investors. “The FDA has become more unpredictable,” says Chan.

OK, it has had the distraction of the pandemic and the need to focus on vaccines and therapies. But now with COVID-19 winding down (hopefully), perhaps the FDA can refocus on drug approvals.

3. Broader market conditions improve

Investors continue to panic about inflation and recession, because they know the Fed can’t come to the rescue with the proverbial “Fed put” (stimulus to counter stock-market declines).

Since the Fed has taken the training wheels away from investors, they have to think through inflation and GDP growth on their own. So far, they’re doing a poor job since it seems clear inflation has peaked and we aren’t going into recession. Hopefully, they get up to the task soon.

Stocks to consider … or avoid

Chan singles out UCB UCBJY, -3.05% UCB, -1.85% , a Belgian biotech company. Its shares got hit hard in mid-May when the FDA dinged its request for approval of its bimekizumab therapy for the treatment of a chronic inflammatory disease called plaque psoriasis because of some manufacturing inspection issues.

Now it has to reapply, but the data supporting bimekizumab seem sound. It has already been approved in Europe, Japan, Canada and Australia.

She also likes the prospects for two other UCB therapies in late-stage testing for neurological disorders: zilucoplan and rozanolixizumab. Expect more data readouts and applications for approval in the second half of this year, possible catalysts.

Yee singles out Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, +0.50% , Fate Therapeutics FATE, +2.05% and Ventyx Biosciences VTYX, +3.51% .

Vertex has been posting strong revenue growth for its cystic fibrosis treatment trikafta (up 48% in the first quarter to $1.76 billion). It’s also showing good progress on pipeline therapies for cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, kidney disease, diabetes and pain. Its stock is down 14% from April highs of $292.75.

Fate Therapeutics stock has slumped 77% since August, even though there have been no negative developments, says Yee. Fate continues to show progress developing its natural killer cell immunotherapies for cancer. Fate doesn’t need to raise capital soon. It has a partnership with Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.18% to develop cancer therapies.

Ventyx Biosciences develops therapies for inflammatory diseases like psoriasis, arthritis, Crohn’s disease and colitis. It expects key Phase I trial data on two of them over the next four months.

The companies trading ‘for free’

Yee cautions against thinking companies trading below cash might get bought out simply because their science can technically be purchased for free. “They likely suffered from negative events,” he says. But he does have buy ratings on Olema Pharmaceuticals OLMA, -3.04% , which has around $7 per share in cash vs. a recent stock price of $2.10, and LianBio LIAN, -2.01% ($3.76 in cash vs. $2.47 stock price).

Olema is conducting early-stage studies of therapies for breast cancer. LianBio helps partners study and develop their therapies in China. It has a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY, -0.22% , for example, to develop a cardiovascular therapy there called mavacamten, approved in the U.S. Yee thinks this China angle alone is worth $13 a share for LianBio. It’s partnering with other companies to develop therapies for inflammation, respiratory and eye disorders.

“We appreciate sentiment may continue to be challenging on China stocks, but the company has plenty of cash to execute on the pipeline and ongoing trials including the lead mavacamten asset,” says Yee.

Note that these are tiny sub-$300 million market cap companies which can be quite risky in biotech.

Vaccine stocks

Moderna MRNA, -5.52% , Pfizer PFE, +2.90% and Novavax NVAX, -10.45% are way off the highs seen in the thick of the pandemic. But Yee cautions against getting too bullish on them. The reason: It seems like the pandemic is receding, and large vaccine buyers around the world have been opting out of purchase options and deferring shipments.

240,Two major banks expect more pain for US equities,2022-05-19 08:13:51,"
LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Two major banks expect more pain for the U.S. stock markets after benchmark indexes posted on Wednesday their worst one-day losses in two years.

In a report published on Thursday, Barclays strategists said margins for U.S. companies and their forward earnings were under pressure due to a combination of factors, ranging from severity of China's COVID lockdowns to the war in Ukraine and the U.S. Federal Reserve's hawkish stance.

""Given the numerous negative near-term catalysts for the SPX we believe that the risks remain firmly stacked to the downside,"" they said in a note, referring to the S&P 500 (.SPX).


A key drag on the index had been underwhelming results posted in the current earnings season by the high-flying FAANG group - Meta Platforms (FB.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Alphabet (GOOGL.O) - Barclays said. The weak results had been the largest negative contribution to the broader index in seven years.

Moreover, fiscal stimulus unleashed during the pandemic had resulted in record consumption of goods as consumers spent during lockdowns, Barclays said. This had translated into strong corporate earnings in the past two years.

Now that consumer spending was switching to services, support for earnings would not be so strong.

Separately, Goldman Sachs strategists estimated a 35% probability of the U.S. economy entering a recession in the next two years.

Furthermore, investors' behaviour in the U.S. stock market, rotating out of some categories of shares and into others, suggested they were pricing in even greater odds of a downturn.

The S&P 500 is down more than 18% so far in 2022 and the Nasdaq has fallen about 27%, dragged lower by tumbling growth stocks. Almost two-thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs, according to Refinitiv data.

Goldman Sachs said that in 12 recessions since World War Two, U.S. stocks had fallen from peak to trough by a median of 24%.

A decline of that magnitude from the January peak would take stocks 11% below current market levels. An average drop from the peak would be 18%.

Dividend futures represented a second market indicator pricing an outcome consistent with recession, the U.S. investment bank's strategists said. Dividend futures implied S&P 500 dividends would fall by nearly 5% in 2023.

In the past 60 years, trailing four-quarter S&P 500 dividends had never fallen on an annual basis outside of a recession, Goldman Sachs said.

Even retail investors, typically contrarian in recent market selloff episodes, are selling, according to data.

Intra-week selling by retail traders was the worst since March 2020, according to JP Morgan. Charles Schwab net assets suffered outflows for the first time since 2020.

241,As Global Trade Gets a Reboot Heres How to Profit,2022-05-20 10:14:00,"Globalization reshaped the world economy over the past four decades, linking countries through the free flow of capital, people, and goods to bolster growth and—at least in theory—engender geopolitical harmony. Along the way, it built China into an economic powerhouse, pulled more than a billion people out of poverty, and created a burgeoning middle-class hungry for U.S. goods.

As the world grew closer, U.S. companies tapped low-cost labor abroad to create efficient global supply chains, reducing the need for warehouses filled with inventory and contributing to record profits and a free flow of cheap goods that helped keep a lid on inflation.

Much of that is now in question. U.S.-China tensions, the pandemic, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have exposed the risks of global integration. China’s ascent into a formidable economic and geopolitical rival has pushed the U.S. to increasingly view its relationship with the world’s most populous country through a national-security lens.

That has been compounded by pandemic-related disruptions. U.S. hospitals are rationing X-rays and CT scans because of shortages in chemicals, in turn caused by factory shutdowns thousands of miles away. Apple (ticker: AAPL) has warned that it could take as much as an $8 billion hit to sales in the current quarter as China’s zero-Covid policy interrupts supply chains and dents economic activity. India and Turkey are banning exports of grains and agricultural products as the war in Ukraine exacerbates food security concerns.

“For years, companies operated on the belief that periodic tensions with China or Russia wouldn’t disrupt critical supply chains covering goods, energy, metals, and minerals,” says Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “That assumption is no longer the case,”

Globalization 2.0 will take shape over years, but the early contours are already visible, with more companies and countries stressing safety and resiliency over cost and efficiency as they look to diversify and duplicate supply chains around the world.

A byproduct, at least in the short term, could be more trade as companies build up inventory as buffers. Even with the trade war, export restrictions that blacklisted some Chinese companies from U.S. technology, and supply-chain disruptions, global trade hit a record $28.5 trillion last year—13% higher than in prepandemic 2019.

In the long run, Globalization 2.0 is likely to be less lucrative for the private sector as governments direct a larger share of investments, often on national-security rather than economic grounds.

“The economic costs are going to be real,” says Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The result, he says, will be “lost opportunities,” lower returns on investment, and increased volatility.

That volatility could mean opportunity for investors in companies that are facilitating this shift by helping countries become more self-sufficient in critical areas such as semiconductors, or building production closer to home or in friendlier destinations.

Shares of many of these companies could get even cheaper in the coming months as the market digests recession concerns and the broader shifts at play. U.S. equities are baking in earnings growth for the next decade that suggests little change—even as the forces that boosted corporate profits are now challenged, says Rebecca Patterson, chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates, who sees reason for caution.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warns that the end of globalization as we know it is near—and could bring higher costs and margin pressures. Whirlpool CEO Marc Bitzer recently told analysts that the appliance giant was trying to reposition itself for a “new reality” of geopolitical tensions, freight cost inflation, and increased trade barriers as a result of the decoupling of global economies.

Big changes are ahead in areas linked to national security—including semiconductors and the rare earths critical to tomorrow’s technologies. Congress is expected to pass a China package this summer that includes money for more domestic semiconductor production and incentives to bring manufacturing of critical goods home—or at least move production to friendly countries.

China is moving to shore up its own technology and food security, as well as reduce its reliance on the dollar following the West’s sanctions on Russia. China is banning senior officials of the Communist Party and their families from holding real estate abroad or shares in companies registered abroad, The Wall Street Journal reported this past week.

Barring a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a decoupling that completely unwinds globalization is unlikely, considering the deep financial and economic ties between the U.S. and China. Exports to China represented about 858,000 U.S. jobs in 2020. More than 300 congressional districts have 1,000 or more jobs supported by those exports, according to the U.S.-China Business Council.

“The winners of this coming wave of globalization will be India and Southeast Asia. Everyone wants to invest there.” — Parag Khanna, founder of global strategic advisory firm FutureMap

The latest survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China indicated that about half of respondents delayed or decreased investments because of the latest Covid outbreak. Just 14% of businesses surveyed last year by the U.S.-China Business Council reported moving any part of their supply chain out of China. But strategists expect more new investment beyond China as companies look for regional alternatives and countries form regional blocs with like-minded nations.

Parag Khanna, founder of global strategic advisory firm FutureMap, says the U.S. is well positioned for this next wave because it is relatively self-reliant on multiple fronts. At the same time, he sees the center of gravity in trade moving east.

China accounts for 15% of global exports, nearly twice that of the U.S., and is the largest trading partner for just about every major country. China also sits at the center of the world’s largest trade bloc—the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership—which includes Japan and Indonesia, plus a dozen other countries.

Countries are hesitant to pick sides, even as the U.S. begins a campaign to bolster its Indo-Pacific alliance and form closer relationships with India and Southeast Asia.

“The winners of this coming wave of globalization will be India and Southeast Asia. Everyone wants to invest there: There’s a growing middle class and a more open society and democratic ways not found in China,” Khanna says. “They are in the sweet spot of geography, geopolitics, and demography.”

The transition to Globalization 2.0 promises to be gradual and messy, but investors can use the recent global market selloff to identify winners and recalibrate their assumptions about profits, economic growth, and returns.

Three funds and nine companies serve to illustrate the investments in the sweet spot for the upheavals to come.

India’s size, young workforce, and democratic system put it in an attractive spot as companies seek alternatives to China. India is stepping up efforts to become more competitive for manufacturers, cutting taxes and offering incentives to bolster its “Made in India” push, says Matthew Dreith, associate portfolio manager of the Wasatch Emerging Markets Select fund.

The iShares MSCI India exchange-traded fund (INDA) is a broad-based way into the action. Indian industrial companies are another, including air-compressor maker Elgi Equipments (522074.India), which is poised to take market share as companies seek alternative suppliers. It should also see increased demand as companies build duplicative supply chains around the world. Air compressors are widely used in manufacturing plants. Elgi’s valuation—50 times forward earnings—looks pricey, but Dreith says that long-depressed spending is picking up. That should boost margins, and the company’s heavy investments in Europe and U.S. should begin to pay off.

Low labor costs and an established manufacturing base should drive investment into Mexico from U.S. companies looking to bring its suppliers closer to home. While a slowdown in the U.S. could weigh on Mexico, in the longer term, the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF (EWW) offers a way to tap increased investment in the country.

Another beneficiary: Prologis Property Mexico (FIBRAPL14.Mexico), a $2.2 billion real estate investment trust that manages logistics and warehouses, and estimates that 30% of its manufacturing demand came from near-shoring last year. Increased near-shoring, along with growth in e-commerce and supply-chain disruptions, should help the company generate double-digit earnings growth for some time to come, says Matthews Emerging Markets Equity manager John Paul Lech.

Another promising area is emerging as governments look to become more self-reliant. China has laid out a road map of its priorities, with plans to generate 10% of its gross domestic product from the digital economy by 2025, making semiconductors and software critical to its goals. Sung Cho, senior manager for Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s Fundamental Equity, favors local companies like Kingdee International Software Group (268.Hong Kong) and semiconductor makers like Taiwan’s Silergy (6415.Taiwan).

The sharp selloff in Chinese stocks amid concerns about the economy and Beijing’s Covid shutdowns left these stocks trading at a 30% discount to global peers, despite similar growth rates, says Cho.

Semiconductors are the lifeblood of the global economy—a reason that China and the U.S. are intent on bolstering chip manufacturing at home. Demand for chips is also growing. Electric vehicles require double the number of chips that traditional cars do. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) sits atop the chip industry, with a more than 50% market share of global semiconductors and 95% share of 5-nanometer technology crucial to innovations in areas like artificial intelligence, 5G, and other technologies of tomorrow.

The company has been built for resilience, a byproduct of sitting in a geopolitical hot spot and managing relations with customers around the globe. It is building a $12 billion fabrication plant in Arizona and another plant in Japan, and is considering building plants in Singapore and India. At 15 times forward earnings, Taiwan Semi trades below its five-year average, as the sector is hit by concerns of a global slowdown and supply-chain disruptions.

“They are sensitive to U.S.-China tensions and changing world order and are planning around it—and are still in an extremely strong situation, which the market is unable to price properly,” says Jenny Davis, co-manager of Baillie Gifford’s International Alpha Strategy, which oversees $18.3 billion. The company’s dominance and three-year plan for $100 billion in capital spending is on a “monumental scale. No one else can compete.”

Cho favors semiconductor capital-equipment makers, which are selling at about a 25% discount to the S&P 500 index. KLA (KLAC) is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the buildout in leading-edge chip capacity. The company’s stock price has baked in recession fears but not its long-term potential.

The changing nature of global trade could also spark an industrial revolution as companies build new manufacturing hubs or turn to automation to defer the higher costs of shifting to pricier destinations. Industrials are vulnerable to fears of a global recession, but Elias Cohen, head of the international equity team at Neuberger Berman, sees the volatility as a good time to identify companies that are focused on electrical goods, robotics, and machinery, and are well positioned for the next decade.

The iShares Global Industrial ETF (EXI) is a broad-based way to tap the sector. Another beneficiary: Japan’s SMC (6273.Japan), which holds a roughly 45% global market share in pneumatic controls used in manufacturing and has strong pricing power. After selling automation-related stocks last year as valuations got too rich, Cohen has started to add some back in the recent selloff. SMC, for example, trades at 22 times forward earnings, below its five-year average.

Kennametal (KMT) is a U.S. beneficiary of Globalization 2.0 as efforts to build resilience in supply chains, especially around energy and critical minerals, increase demand for the company’s tools, dyes, and bits used in infrastructure projects and oil-and-gas exploration. It sells for 13 times forward earnings.

Charlie Bobrinskoy, who manages the focused value strategy at Ariel Investments, says the price bakes in a recession, even though he puts the recession odds at 50/50. He says the price doesn’t reflect the company’s longer-term prospects from a new phase of globalization.

Freight forwarder DSV (DSV.Denmark) does best when trade patterns change. The Danish company reported a first-quarter net profit that exceeded what it earned in all of 2019. DSV’s capital-light business model churns out cash flow, and management has a strong record of savvy capital allocation and consolidating the industry, says Baillie Gifford’s Davis. Analysts expect the company’s earnings to rise 25%, to $2.2 billion, or $9.70 a share, on top of a 81% increase last year. “The friction of change pushes customers to outsource their organization of freight transport,” says Davis.

The transition to a new type of globalization will come with its share of disruption. That boosts the case for diversification, not just for companies with their supply chains, but also for investors with their portfolios. The latest market upheaval is a good time to start.

242,Recession fears 30 chance in the next 12 to 24 months Goldman CEO says,2022-05-20 10:08:00,"“‘Probably a 30% chance of recession as you look forward to the next 12 to 24 months.’”

That was Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -1.36% CEO David Solomon talking about the U.S economy during a couple of recent interviews.

Solomon, who has been the chief executive officer at Goldman Sachs GS since 2018, made the prediction in a telephone interview with Bloomberg on Tuesday. He expanded on it during a CNBC interview on Wednesday.

“You have to think about the fact that there’s a reasonable chance at some point that we have a recession or we have, you know, very, very slow, sluggish growth,” Solomon said.

But he also cautioned that a recession is far from a sure thing.

“That doesn’t mean that that’s definitely going to happen,” he continued. “But certainly, I think that if you’re running a significant enterprise, you have to be looking through a lens with a little bit more caution right now than you might have been when we were sitting here a year ago.”

Solomon also noted that the recent “tightening” of economic conditions has been predictable based on inflation data and the interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.

This comes after Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said he is determined to create a “softish landing” for the U.S. economy.

“What we need to see is inflation coming down in a clear and convincing way and we’re going to keep pushing until we see that,” said Powell on Tuesday.

243,Shopify and 5 More Stocks That Arent as Cheap as They Look,2022-05-20 09:49:00,"Stocks are tumbling and bargains abound—if you know where to look. But buying the dip doesn’t work in a bear market, and neither does simply scooping up shares of beaten-down companies. In fact, that can be a recipe for more losses, because, again, what works when stocks are going up doesn’t work when they are going down.

Take earnings. In a bull market, especially one fueled by the Federal Reserve pumping money into the economy, it doesn’t usually matter what kind of numbers a company reports. If the company “beats,” the stock usually rises.

When stocks are falling, however, there’s only one kind of earnings that pass muster—those based on generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP. “For the past few years, you could have ignored accounting, financial statements, or anything else and it didn’t matter,” says Wolfe Research Chief Investment Strategist Chris Senyek. “Now, given that Fed liquidity is being drained and interest rates are increasing, it’s back to fundamentals: balance sheets, cash flow, and reading annual reports.”

Large gaps between operating and GAAP earnings could be a sign that a company isn’t doing nearly as well as it says it is. Those gaps can be driven by factors ranging from acquisitions, restructuring charges, and the use of stock-based compensation such as restricted stock units and options granted to employees and executives in lieu of cash. The latter, in particular, can skew earnings in a way that can result in huge differences between GAAP and adjusted numbers.

To be sure, stock-based comp works great in a rising market. Though it dilutes shareholders, it makes employees want to stick around—and since the stock is rising, everyone benefits. But when stocks are falling, companies feel pressure to reprice options, grant even more shares, or pay more cash. “That’s going to increase their cost structure,” Senyek says.

Here are six stocks that have fallen hard this year but, due to high levels of stock comp, aren’t as cheap as they look.

Company / Ticker Recent Price YTD Change 2023E P/E 2023E GAAP P/E CrowdStrike Holdings / CRWD $142.64 -30.3% 90.3 N/A E=estimate, N/A=not applicable Source: FactSet

Cybersecurity technology company CrowdStrike Holdings (ticker: CRWD) is growing fast—its earnings could increase by 66% in fiscal year 2023—fast enough, perhaps, to convince some investors to overlook the fact that it’s trading at 90 times 2023 earnings estimates. But CrowdStrike paid out $310 million in stock-based compensation in fiscal 2022. Convert that to cash compensation and it would consume about 70% of the $442 million free cash flow CrowdStrike generated in fiscal 2022, while reported earnings would become losses. CrowdStrike might save you from a cyberattack; just don’t count on it to rescue your portfolio right now.

Company / Ticker Recent Price YTD Change 2023E P/E 2023E GAAP P/E Snowflake / SNOW 146.82 -56.7 341.4 N/A E=estimate, N/A=not applicable Source: FactSet

Snowflake (SNOW), a fast-growing cloud-based provider of data and analytics products, is expected to turn a 16 cents per share profit this fiscal year, its largest since going public in spectacular fashion in 2020. That might seem like a sign that it’s time for investors to check in on the badly beaten-up stock. Snowflake’s GAAP earnings, however, aren’t as attractive: They record a $2.22 a share loss, transforming its price/earnings ratio from more than 900 times to nonexistent. Once again, the gap between the two numbers is the result of plentiful stock-based compensation, which is equal to about half of Snowflake’s sales over the past two years.

Company / Ticker Recent Price YTD Change 2023E P/E 2023E GAAP P/E Shopify / SHOP 391.33 -71.6 185.5 N/A E=estimate, N/A=not applicable Source: FactSet

Shopify (SHOP) was an e-commerce darling in 2020 and 2021, with shares soaring almost 250% amid pandemic lockdowns. Now, the stock is trading around where it started in 2020. An opportunity for bargain-hunting investors? Not quite. Shopify trades at 185 times 2023 earnings estimates of $2.11, but stock-based compensation amounted to about 10% of first-quarter sales. That might not seem huge, but when added back to financial results, profits turn into losses. Shopify is now allowing employees to choose between stock and cash pay. If employees opt for cash, it becomes an expense that will show up no matter what earnings metric you use.

Company / Ticker Recent Price YTD Change 2023E P/E 2023E GAAP P/E Zscaler / ZS 132.30 -58.8 115.0 N/A E=estimate, N/A=not applicable Source: FactSet

With stock compensation of $104 million in the fiscal-second quarter, equal to about 41% of sales, Zscaler (ZS), which develops cloud-based security software, is one of the heavier users of options and shares on Senyek’s list. If stock-based compensation were cash, Zscaler’s quarterly free cash flow would drop from $29 million to a loss of $75 million. Its P/E would go from more than 230 times to also, well, nothing, because GAAP earnings would show a $2.57 loss. Zscaler screens as one of the companies with the highest level of stock-based compensation on Senyek’s list. Even down 59% in 2022, the stock is no bargain.

Company / Ticker Recent Price YTD Change 2023E P/E 2023E GAAP P/E Lyft / LYFT 19.29 -54.9 20.7 N/A E=estimate, N/A=not applicable Source: FactSet

Lyft (LYFT) stock has plunged 55% in 2022, and that has left it looking far cheaper than it was just a short time ago. Shares are trading at about nine times estimated 2023 earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, or Ebitda, down from 26 times at the start of 2022. With the S&P 500 trading at about 12 times estimated Ebitda, that makes Lyft seem almost a value play. But stock-based compensation makes up 18% of Lyft’s first-quarter sales. Back that out, and 2023 Ebitda would be closer to minus $360 million instead of the roughly $600 million profit that analysts project. Lyft can get you from point A to point B. Just don’t consider its stock a value.

Company / Ticker Recent Price YTD Change 2023E P/E 2023E GAAP P/E PayPal Holdings / PYPL 81.28 -56.9 16.7 25.3 E=estimate Source: FactSet

PayPal Holdings (PYPL) stock is down about 57% year to date and now trades for roughly 17 times estimated 2023 earnings. That’s a below-market multiple for an established fintech company—one that’s expected to grow its earnings by roughly 25%. It looks like a bargain, except for the fact that stock-based compensation amounted to just 7% of PayPal’s first-quarter sales. While that might seem low, adding comp back to the numbers would mean earnings are closer to $3.21 a share, rather than $4.86 a share. PayPal stock would be trading at 25 times the unadjusted number, not quite attractive enough to consider the shares a value.

244,A Profit Recession Is Brewing Expert Says Hunker Down in Cash,2022-05-20 09:46:00,"If there is one person who wasn’t shocked by the massive misses in big retailers’ results this past week, it’s our longtime (but no way old) pal, Stephanie Pomboy, who heads the MacroMavens institutional economic advisory. Even though she has been coping with a (thankfully) mild case of Covid-19, she’s still as sharp, and acerbic, as ever in sizing up the current situation.

Not to lose the short-attention-span types, here are some of Steph’s searing insights:

We’re now experiencing withdrawal pangs after the massive injection of fiscal and monetary stimulus of the past two years, which actually boosted asset values more than real economic activity. With manna no longer falling from Washington, consumers are resorting to credit cards to pay the soaring costs of incidental items, such as food, energy, and rent. Companies also are getting squeezed. Producer prices are racing farther ahead of consumer prices by the biggest margin on record,

There’s also some good news. Amid the shortages of everything out there, the supply of one thing—labor—might improve. Some folks enriched by the soaring prices of assets, whether stocks, houses, or cryptocurrencies, joined the leisure class for a while. As asset prices start to deflate, some of these nouveau riche face the chastening prospect of actually having to return to work.

Pomboy says that both Wall Street and the Federal Reserve have woefully underestimated stimulus policies’ role in the current recovery. After Uncle Sam injected approximately $10 trillion in fiscal and monetary largess into the U.S. economy, nominal gross domestic product increased by about $2.3 trillion, a pathetic bang for the buck. Household net worth ballooned by $34 trillion, however, which compares with the $24 trillion U.S. economy. In effect, U.S. consumers were handed roughly two full years of income, via the increased value of their houses and of their 401(k) accounts and other securities holdings.

Now the movie is on rewind. The notion of consumers sitting on an ample cushion of savings is wrong, Pomboy says, with personal savings back to the December 2019 level. Credit-card balances, which were slashed after America received its government stimulus fix, are ramping up at a record 16% annual clip. It’s hard to imagine consumers taking on double-digit interest charges on plastic if they weren’t strapped to pay the escalating tabs at the checkout counter, gas pump, and rental office, she adds.

The stresses that dominate the everyday lives of most Americans shocked Wall Street via the first-quarter earnings reports from retailers this past week, highlighted by the 28.7% two-day swoon by Target (ticker: TGT) on Wednesday and Thursday. The soaring food, energy, and housing expenses are crowding out discretionary spending, Pomboy says. Retailers who cater to the hoi polloi can’t pass on their rising costs, resulting in massive margin squeezes that are decimating their stocks.

Yet to be seen is the effect of the now-deflating asset bubble. She passed along a chart of the JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) overlaid with the Wilshire 5000 index, which measures the broad U.S. stock market in dollars. Through the most recent reading in March, the tightening in the labor market indicated by JOLTS moved in virtual lockstep with the Wilshire.

Sometime soon, however, the reverse could happen. According to Wilshire Associates, the U.S. stock market has shed some $10.1 trillion in value, or 19.9%, this year through Thursday. The losses are relatively recent, with $7.1 trillion of that drop coming since the current quarter began, including $2.6 trillion in May, $1.7 trillion of which was torched just in Wednesday’s rout.

That doesn’t take into account the approximately trillion dollars in cryptocurrency wealth that’s evaporated globally this year, according to Goldman Sachs’ economic team, led by Jan Hatzius. Declines in household wealth point to a significant drag on spending, not so much from crypto as from conventional assets. Equities accounted for about 33% of household wealth at the end of 2021, compared with just 0.3% for crypto, they write in a client note.

Labor-force participation among younger males—crypto’s main fan base—has nearly fully recovered, the Goldman economists say. Prior academic studies have found that the wealth effect mainly affects labor-force participation among those near retirement age, who might be more apt to take their money and run.

On the surface, the jobs numbers appear to show labor demand continuing to stay ahead of supply. But peering beneath the surface, Pomboy sees confusing data. While April’s establishment survey found a solid 428,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, the separate survey of households showed a 353,000 decline in employment. While the household series (from which the headline jobless rate is derived) tends to be more volatile month to month, she has never seen such a wide split, suggesting there’s something amiss in the figures.

And recently, some big tech companies, including Meta Platforms (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Uber Technologies (UBER), have announced more restrained hiring policies. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have been creeping up, to 218,000 in the week ended May 14. That’s an historically modest level, but it’s still up from the 53-year low of 166,000, touched in March. As profit margins are squeezed, labor costs are certain to go under the microscope.

At the same time, Pomboy adds, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell wants to come across as “Volcker 2.0,” a reference to the Fed chief who vanquished inflation four decades ago with 20% interest rates and back-to-back recessions. And equity analysts have yet to seriously pare their earnings forecasts, with those for consumer-discretionary companies still pointing to 30% gains for 2022, she observes.

Pomboy’s conclusion: We’re in the early innings of an unfolding profit recession. The Fed would likely welcome wage gains if the jobs market weakens. Meanwhile, she advises investors to resist any temptation to buy the dips. Instead, she advises, hunker down in cash; the lows are still a distance away.

245,Its crunch time for the push to ban Congress from trading stocks,2022-05-20 09:11:00,"A China competition bill, additional Ukraine aid, further COVID-19 funding, addressing inflation and more.

U.S. lawmakers face a big to-do list before they take their August recess and then focus primarily on November’s midterm elections, but advocates for a ban on congressional trading of individual stocks sound upbeat about lawmakers managing to deliver on that issue.

“I think there’s great momentum. It’s just not public,” said Donald Sherman, senior vice president and chief counsel for the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a watchdog group.

“My understanding is that there’s a Senate compromise bill that is going to be released relatively soon. That is a compromise insofar as it combined elements from lots of people’s bills.”

Sherman said by “soon” he means “by this time next month.”

The CREW expert also pointed to some progress in the House of Representatives, following the House Administration Committee’s April 7 hearing on possible new limits on the buying and selling of individual stocks by lawmakers. Sherman said he received “pretty robust” additional questions from that panel earlier this week after testifying at that hearing — “which suggests to me that members are in the weeds on what comprehensive legislation might look like.”

“I would think that the Senate would aim to get something across the finish line before August recess, so that then the House can resolve and pass something in the fall,” Sherman added.

“This is an issue that members of Congress are either going to run on — or run from — in November. And so I think that timeline makes sense, in order to ensure that members can go back to their districts in the fall and demonstrate that they have gotten this across the finish line.”

Around 63% of all voters favor a ban on stock trading for lawmakers, with support at 69% among Democrats and 58% among Republicans, according to a recent Morning Consult/Politico poll. But the issue doesn’t rank as urgent, as Americans are focused on inflation, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, immigration, climate change and election laws, according to a Quinnipiac University survey.

The raft of bipartisan bills aiming to stop congressional trading in individual stocks has been driven in part by reports about lawmakers who bought and sold stocks in the COVID-19 pandemic’s early days after they were privy to warnings — along with news that many lawmakers have been late with their disclosures. Other reports have raised additional questions, including a MarketWatch article in January that revealed how Congress resembled a Wall Street trading desk last year, with lawmakers and their family members making an estimated total of $355 million worth of stock trades as the market SPX, -0.54% DJIA, -0.44% soared.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat, told reporters last week that he hopes to have stock-trading legislation to vote on “this year.”

“That’s a sign that there still is some momentum there, but there’s not a desire to commit to a particular timeline,” said Jennifer Schulp, an expert from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

“I view this as one that could pretty quickly shift,” she added, meaning the timing for a vote “could very easily turn into June or July, if it if it turns into a priority.”

Schulp, the director of financial regulation studies at the Cato’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said she doesn’t support a ban on congressional trading of individual stocks, saying it wouldn’t restore trust in Congress or address other conflicts of interests.

She favors measures that would increase transparency, such as cutting the amount of time allowed between a trade and the required disclosure, or raising the penalties for not filing disclosures correctly. She also was a witness at the April 7 hearing.

While Congress is busy trying to tackle inflation, a baby-formula shortage and other matters, the push for a stock-trading ban is “not in contention with those other issues,” said Liz Hempowicz, director of public policy at the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), a watchdog that has lobbied for a ban that would cover lawmakers, their spouses and dependents.

“I think it’s all related, and the public needs to know that Congress can approach those kitchen-table issues with clear eyes and with the public interest at the front and center,” Hempowicz said. The alternative is Americans end up concerned about lawmakers handling a matter “with their own pocketbook in mind,” she said.

Public sentiment in favor of a ban helps make her “cautiously optimistic” on achieving it, added Hempowicz, who was among the witnesses on April 7 as well.

“Things are moving. It’s just behind the scenes,” she said.

Critics of a ban say it would discourage people from running for office, or it would be difficult to implement, especially with blind trusts being considered. Another argument is that U.S. lawmakers should understand what it’s like to invest in stocks given that they decide policy about the equity market.

Rep. Spanberger’s take, President Biden’s role

One House lawmaker who has co-sponsored one of the bills that would end congressional trading in individual stocks sounded somewhat discouraged in an interview this week, even as she seemed excited by Schumer’s comment about a Senate vote in 2022.

“Hopefully we’ll see them lead by example — faster than we might see action in the House, which is sad to me since we’re supposed to be the people’s House,” said Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, referring to the Senate.

“But if that’s the reality, then I look forward to them doing the right thing, and then ideally, hopefully, the House will follow suit.”

The Senate is dealing with “too many competing ideas,” but the problem in the House “is not coalescing around legislation,” she said. “The issue is House leadership doesn’t want to move this. That’s the problem in the House.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat, defended stock trading by lawmakers and their spouses in December, but then in January reversed herself to some extent, asking the House Administration Committee to look into a possible ban on congressional trading and saying: “I just don’t buy into that. But if members want to do that, I’m OK with that.”

Pelosi ranked as the eighth-biggest trader last year among Congress’s more than 500 members, with $12 million in buys and no sells. That’s according to MarketWatch’s January report, which used a Capitol Trades analysis of disclosures filed by members of Congress for their trading activity or for their family members’ buys and sells.

Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia speaks on banning stock trades for members of Congress at a news conference on April 7. She’s joined by (L-R) Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-OR), Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) and Rep. Joe Neguse (D-CO). Getty Images

When asked what she’s doing to win over Pelosi, Spanberger said: “Getting more co-sponsors.” Her bill, introduced with Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, has attracted more than 60 co-sponsors — “quite a lot of co-sponsors for a bill that’s not imminently coming for a vote,” she said.

The Virginia Democrat decried seeing fellow lawmakers buy shares in pharmaceutical or cleaning-supply companies during the onset of the COVID pandemic, as well as buying stock in a defense company that’s “going to be producing massive amounts of specific weaponry for a war in Ukraine that we knew was coming.”

“The fact that there are members of Congress who think they’re ‘right’ to be able to buy stocks, which equates to profiting off that information, is to me just unconscionable,” Spanberger said.

“I’m continuing to build up a coalition of people who believe that this reform is necessary. But I can’t change everybody’s minds. And sadly there’s numbers behind why some people might not be inclined to support it.”

An additional hurdle could be the 50-50 Senate’s filibuster rule, in which 60 votes are required to end debate on most items, so the minority party is able to stymie the majority’s efforts. But some Republican senators have backed bills focused on congressional trading, including Tennessee’s Marsha Blackburn, Montana’s Steve Daines, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham and Missouri’s Josh Hawley.

Another watchdog group that’s pushing for a ban is planning to get President Joe Biden involved, hoping that could spark action.

“We will send a letter requesting that he push this through and basically follow his campaign promise to push for laws where Congress is not influenced by their personal financial holdings,” said Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics and general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center (CLC). That refers to a Biden campaign pledge to work with Congress to enact laws that would stop lawmakers from being influenced by those holdings.

That letter, with signatures from a range of groups, is likely to go out this week or next week, according to Payne.

The CLC expert ties passage of 2012’s STOCK Act to a strong nudge from then-President Barack Obama during a State of the Union address. That law requires disclosures of stock trades by lawmakers, and it aims to help prevent politicians from insider trading, but it’s viewed as insufficient by some watchdog groups.

“It was recognized” a decade ago that the president could deliver “a push from outside of the legislature, and that’s what needs to happen now,” Payne said.

“This problem of perceived conflicts of interest with stock trading is not going away, and it will get worse unless Congress acts right away,” he added.

246,Privateequity lawyers eye valuation headwinds from interest rates war and deglobalization,2022-05-20 08:40:00,"From sharply lower private-company valuations to tougher review of cross-border acquisitions, the world of private-equity deal making faces fresh challenges in 2022, corporate lawyers who work with financial sponsors say.

All told, the deal business remains mostly robust for alternative players with private-equity and venture-capital transactions increasing 6% globally to $98.8 billion in April, according to data released Friday by S&P Global Market Intelligence. In a sign of trouble, however, the number of deals in April fell 22% to 1,611.

While the private-equity world remains partially insulated from daily moves in the stock market, it hasn’t escaped the macroeconomic carnage caused by steep losses in public-market equity prices in the face of inflation and potential recession.

High-flying, money-losing unicorns are seeing their private market valuations drop sharply as deal makers ponder the impact of higher interest rates on companies that burn cash.

The Softbank Corp.–backed SFTBY, +1.06% buy-now-pay-later financial technology company Klarna Bank AB has seen its valuation fall to about $15 billion now from $46 billion a year ago as it attempts to raise fresh capital, the Wall Street Journal reported.

See: When companies outgrow unicorn size, what should we call them?

Markus Bolsinger, a partner at Dechert who works with private-backed companies on deal making, said higher interest rates take a heavy toll on so-called unicorn valuations, since they shape cash-flow projections for money-losing companies.

If a private company needs capital, its cost of borrowing has already been higher, but now the interest charged on loans are climbing fast as overall interest rates rise. This dynamic has made private-equity firms and venture-capital funds that back private companies more cautious about money-losing operations.

When considering equity infusions into companies, private-equity firms also shape their investments according to the valuations of comparable companies.

“When using a discounted-cash-flow model to value a company, those cash flows get more heavily discounted when interest rates increase,” Bolsinger said. “There’s been a shift to focusing on profitability and a push for venture-capital-backed early-stage and growth companies to conserve cash and reach a path to profitability earlier. ”

Besides interest rates, other headwinds to deal making are linked to rising geopolitical tensions, whether it’s protecting intellectual property from China or needing to adhere to sanctions against Russia and billionaire associates of Vladimir Putin.

Mark Thierfelder, chair of Dechert’s global private-equity practice, said more headwinds face cross-border deals in both the private-equity and corporate deal-making worlds, amid an overall trend of deglobalization.

Regulators have gotten more aggressive on antitrust enforcement of deals, he said.

Also, rules around foreign direct investment have become more strict in many jurisdictions as governments move to weigh national-security implications of overseas ownership.

In the U.S., the Committee on Foreign Investment in the U.S., known as Cifius, has been flexing its muscles to review cross-border deals such as China-based Foxconn EV Technology Inc.’s $230 acquisition of a Lordstown Motors Corp. factory in Ohio that once belonged to General Motors Co. GM, -2.38% .

Other countries such as India have been moving to update similar regimes to review whether M&A tie-ups hurt national security.

“Borders have hardened,” Thierfelder said.

Economic sanctions against Russia have also forced private-equity firms to freeze investments from companies and individuals with close ties to Putin in the wake of his unprovoked Ukraine invasion.

Higher interest rates and jitters about inflation and a recession have also made financing M&A transactions more challenging, said Lindsay Flora, who specializes in private debt offerings.

“A lot of deals aren’t getting done,” she said. “Banks are looking closely at each deal. Larger banks are more hesitant while direct lenders are more active partly because they face fewer regulations.”

The syndicated bank market for loans remains more challenging and she’s been working on one deal that’s been in the market for three months, Flora said. She declined to provide any details.

Accounting of expenses related to the COVID-19 pandemic remain in flux as well. Debate continues over which expenses related to the pandemic should or should not be added back into Ebitda and cash flow numbers used to craft valuations.

247,Heres the real reason the stock market is coming unglued  and it isnt because of weak earnings,2022-05-20 07:18:00,"An earnings recession is not the biggest threat facing the stock market right now. That may seem a curious assertion to make in a week in which the largest retailers are reporting disappointing earnings and retail-sector stocks are being pummeled.

In fact, contracting P/E multiples are the big culprit. To show that an earnings recession doesn’t necessarily doom the stock market, consider the S&P 500’s SPX, -0.62% quarterly return when its earnings-per-share (EPS) is falling. On average over the past century, according to an analysis conducted by Ned Davis Research, the S&P 500 has performed better when its EPS were lower than a year previously — not higher.

What the research firm uncovered is summarized in the chart below. Notice that the S&P 500’s best quarterly returns in the past have come when its trailing four-quarter EPS were between 20% lower and 5% higher than where they were one year prior. With the exception of quarters in which EPS were more than 20% lower than a year earlier, there’s an inverse relationship between EPS growth and the S&P 500’s performance.

Might that exception apply now? It seems most unlikely. Even with companies’ recent reduced earnings projections, Standard & Poor’s estimates that the stock market’s trailing four-quarter EPS as of June 30 will be 28% higher than the comparable total on June 30, 2021.

What causes changes in P/E multiples?

In pointing the finger at earnings multiples rather than declining earnings, I am relying on nothing more than simple arithmetic. The market’s level at any given time is equal to E times P/E, so if earnings (E) aren’t to blame, then the only other possibility is the multiple (P/E).

Over the past year, the U.S. stock market’s P/E multiple (based on trailing 12 months’ GAAP EPS) has fallen to below 20 from more than 30. Had the multiple remained constant, the S&P 500 today would be 28% higher than a year ago. In fact it is 6% lower.

What caused the P/E multiple to fall by so much? There are numerous factors, but perhaps the most important is inflation. History teaches us that P/E multiples on average are higher when inflation is lower, and vice versa.

This inverse correlation makes sense — to a point. As many have noted in recent months, a higher inflation rate means that future years’ earnings must be discounted at a greater rate when calculating their present value.

Nevertheless, this reasoning — which is widely repeated — is but half the story. The other half, as I pointed out in a column six months ago, is that nominal corporate earnings per-share tend to grow faster when inflation is higher. Over the past 150 years, this faster EPS growth has largely offset the lower P/E multiples when inflation heats up — leaving the stock market, on average, relatively unscathed during periods of higher inflation. This helps explain the results summarized in the chart.

Most investors overlook this tendency for nominal earnings to grow faster in higher-inflation environments — an error that economists refer to as “inflation illusion.” It is not just investors who are guilty of this, furthermore; company executives are, too. FactSet reports that 85% of S&P 500 companies have cited inflation in their earnings calls for the first quarter — the highest percentage since at least since 2010.

Rather than lament investors’ error, a more shrewd response would be to bet against their mistaken beliefs. One way to do that would be to place buy orders below the market price on companies with strong earnings. To the extent investors unjustly punish those companies’ shares, you will scoop up some of them at a bargain. If so, history suggests that eventually you will turn a handsome profit.

248,Opinion The worst of all worlds for investors What if higher interest rates and a recession dont tame inflation,2022-05-19 10:56:00,"There is a big debate about whether central banks will need to generate a recession to force inflation lower.

For the doves, such action is not necessary because the “cure for high prices is high prices.” And this, sort of, makes sense: With wages failing to keep pace with prices, consumers all over the world are already facing a massive squeeze on their real incomes. (Please see chart 1, below.)

Yet, not everyone agrees. As the once uber-dovish Adam Posen put it in a recent FT article: “If declines in real incomes drove inflation cycles, we wouldn’t need monetary policy. The whole reason you need policy-induced recessions is that real income doesn’t reduce inflation unless labor-market conditions ease.”

Read: A ‘summer of pain’ for the stock market

With transitory explanations of inflation now clearly out of fashion, Posen’s analysis leads us to a very gloomy conclusion: A recession may now be inevitable, perhaps even “necessary.”

And while the past few months have been painful for risk assets, there is no way a recessionary outcome is currently priced in. So far, in fact, the hawkishness of central banks has merely deflated the “COVID asset-price bubble.”

The lesson from the 1970s is not encouraging. The U.S., for example, suffered three recessions during that decade, with each downturn the result of a large spike in commodity prices, which killed real incomes.

But the underlying inflation problem never went away. Prices slowed during each downturn —as the commodity shock faded — but then reaccelerated, typically on a faster trend than before the recession. And this continued until central banks, most notably the Volcker Fed, engineered their own recession, raising interest rates sufficiently to put millions of people out of work.

In the 1970s, it eventually took extremely tight policy and mass unemployment to “break the back of inflation.” From an investor point of view, this was the worst of all worlds — countercyclical inflation (stagflation) that produced a persistent positive correlation between bond and equity returns.

So why didn’t the 1970s recessions “cure” inflation?

First, each downturn was relatively short-lived. Sudden price spikes cut spending power, but then real incomes bounced back. In today’s context, this is, sort of, good news because it points to a soft patch rather than a deep slump.

Second, workers secured higher wages even as the economy deteriorated. This effectively replaced one source of cost-push inflation (commodities) with another (labor). The whole episode is synonymous with “wage-price spirals,” essentially a power struggle between labor and capital. Productivity declined and society spent the next decade trying to figure out who should bear the burden of this adjustment, until neoliberalism (Thatcherism, Reaganomics, etc.) provided a definitive answer: By crushing worker power.

Up to that point, a young militant workforce was able to resist any sustained real-wage squeeze. And, at least for a period in the late 1970s, the private sector borrowed heavily and reduced its savings, which also delayed the moment of pain.

What does this mean today? Households and businesses can respond to the consumer price index (CPI) shock in three ways:

Spend the same in nominal terms and accept a reduction in real spending. The economy will slow, perhaps even contract, but things will improve once costs stabilize (though there is always a risk of “non-linear” effects, especially if unemployment increases and you get further rounds of contraction). Reduce savings, or borrow more, to preserve real spending power. This will limit the hit to the economy and inflation should eventually subside. But people cannot sustain this for long. Resist the squeeze by demanding higher wages. Real GDP and employment will remain resilient, but the inflation problem lingers, probably at levels that are inconsistent with central banks’ targets.

Central banks are obsessed with the third of these scenarios, which is why they are watching wages especially closely. While a 1970s-style wage-price spiral does not seem very likely — basically because our governments have spent the past 40 years dismantling the institutions that produced those dynamics — policymakers are clearly worried about the tightness they are seeing in labor markets.

The threat that wages could produce a more persistent inflation overshoot seems much greater in the U.S. (and, to a lesser extent, the U.K.) than in the euro area and Japan.

But in all jurisdictions, it is clear that the ghosts of the 1970s are causing central banks to constantly ratchet up their hawkishness, regardless of what is happening to economic growth.

Naturally, this is creating a really difficult environment for financial markets. Leading indicators are set to deteriorate, perhaps sharply, but inflation anxiety will linger, which means we are a long way from any dovish pivot from central banks. Even if this is not “the end of the cycle” — that comes later if inflation fails to settle at tolerable levels — the next few months could be ugly.

249,A larger share of younger investors say theyre not afraid to buy the dip in the pursuit of longterm gains  but theres one big caveat,2022-05-19 00:01:00,"The stock market is taking on a deepening red hue as steep sell-offs continue, but a new report says some younger retail investors are seeing red meat for ‘buys.’

Fewer than two in ten people, 18%, say they feel optimistic enough to put more money in the market this year, according to a Bankrate survey released this week.

But a closer look into exactly who’s ready to put more money in the market — and see red meat rather than just red — reveals they skew younger, and by a lot.

“A closer look into exactly who’s ready to put more money in the market reveals they skew a lot younger.”

Some 43% of investors who said they’re ready to increase their investments (43%) are ages 18 to 25. More than a quarter, 27%, were millennials ages 26 to 41.

But only14% of investors ages 41 to 57, the so-called Gen X demographic, said they’d pour more money in and 16% of that demographic said they’d invest less.

Meanwhile, just 8% of baby boomers, ages 58 to 76, said they were likely to invest more in the market this year and 22% said they’d be investing less.

Younger poll participants were also more likely to say they were actively making moves in response to the market volatility.

But there’s one big caveat.

The new survey was fielded a month ago — before Wednesday’s stock-market rout in the face of inflation jitters.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.43% and S&P 500 SPX, -0.53% were barely holding onto positive territory on Friday.

But the recent sea of red on markets is only a possible fraction of what’s to come, according to an analyst who’s forecasting the potential for the S&P 500 to take a 45% cruel summer skid from a January peak.

“‘We begin to notice a widening gap in sentiment between the younger (more aggressive) and the older (wealthier) generation.’” — Vanda Research

The Bankrate survey echoes what others are seeing.

“We begin to notice a widening gap in sentiment between the younger (more aggressive) and the older (wealthier) generation,” according to a note Wednesday from Vanda Research, an independent research company offering investment analysis to institutional investors.

The firm’s data signals “the former continues resorting to leverage to buy the dip, whilst the latter has been selling equities primarily via mutual funds,” the note said.

The researchers added “we are now seeing growing signs that wealthier and older individual investors are reducing their overall risk exposure to both equities and bonds.”

It’s understandable why younger investor may be ratcheting up the risk despite all the volatility and talk of recession. After all, their portfolios have more time to recover from deeper bottoms and more time to profit off the bounce back.

“Gen Z and millennial investors’ portfolios have more time to recover from deeper bottoms and more time to profit off the bounce back.” — Greg McBride, Bankrate.com’s chief financial analyst

“Gen Z and millennial investors willing to invest more in stocks this year, despite market volatility and inflation, can see greater long-term reward for the discipline of hanging on and buying more at lower price points,” said Greg McBride, Bankrate.com’s chief financial analyst.

But they’ll have to stay disciplined in what could be their first real down-market test, especially if they just started getting a taste for investing during the pandemic. (Some say they are up for the challenge.)

On the other hand, McBride said baby boomer investors “are nearly three times as likely to invest less in stocks this year, rather than more, as compared to last year but this is entirely consistent with dialing back portfolio risk as retirement looms, begins, or continues, regardless of the overall market environment.”

“ Just when investors think they’ve bought the dip and are poised for a rebound, another bottom could be right around the corner.”

Whatever the age group, financial advisers say the best investment moves right now are gradual and thought-out, not quick and reactive.

Another tip? If a person’s eyeing a particular falling stock, they have to ask themselves if the share price is falling because of problems particular to the company that can be controlled, Jeremy Bohne of Paceline Wealth Management in Boston, Mass, told MarketWatch.

But if it’s general investor mood that’s dragging the price down, the bargain-hunting investor has to fight market sentiment on a broader scale, he said.

Be warned: Just when investors think they’ve successfully bought the dip and are poised for a rebound, another bottom could be right around the corner.

Don’t miss: You just retired and your target-date fund has plunged. What do you do now?

250,Germany and Italy approved Russian gas payments after nod from Brussels  sources,2022-05-20 19:22:47,"
Summary

Summary Companies Some EU states refuse to comply with Russian payment demands

Others approve Russian payments after talks with EU - sources

Diplomats say EU guidance intentionally vague

MILAN/BERLIN, May 20 (Reuters) - Germany and Italy told companies they could open rouble accounts to keep buying Russian gas without breaching sanctions against Moscow following discussions with the European Union, sources said.

The debate over Russia's demand that foreign buyers pay for gas in roubles has tested the resolve of European governments to take a hard line against Moscow over the war in Ukraine.

Poland, Bulgaria and Finland have refused to comply with Moscow's demand that importers pay for gas via rouble accounts with Gazprombank and their supplies have been cut.


Other member states, however, have been unwilling to steer companies towards action that could result in losing vital supplies of Russian gas that heats homes and powers factories.

Brussels has given two sets of written guidance on how to buy Russian gas without breaching sanctions, but the legal route remains foggy as EU officials also advised firms in a closed-door meeting not to open rouble accounts with Gazprombank.

Some diplomats in Brussels from EU member states said they thought the advice was intentionally vague to enable countries to open rouble accounts and keep buying Russian gas.

""One has the impression that it leaves the door open for business as usual,"" one diplomat said, adding that in their view it risked undermining EU unity against Russia if companies in some countries opened rouble accounts but others did not.

""They needed to create a level of creative ambiguity,"" a second diplomat said, referring to the Commission's advice. ""The purpose of creative ambiguity is to create just enough room for all the different interpretations.""

The Commission declined to comment on the discussions.

A Commission spokesman said on Thursday it was not ""advisable"" for companies to open rouble accounts. read more

'GREY ZONE'

Two sources told Reuters that German gas importers have been told by Berlin they can open rouble accounts to pay for Russian gas without violating sanctions, as long as the payments they make to Gazprombank are not in the Russian currency.

The sources said Germany, which is the biggest importer of Russian gas in the region, had consistently acted on the issue in close coordination with the EU.

The Italian government also spoke to the European Commission and received clarity on how to buy Russian gas legally, a senior government source told Reuters.

That happened before Italian energy company Eni (ENI.MI) said on Tuesday it had begun proceedings to open two accounts, one in euros and one in roubles, the source said.

""The decision is in line with what was communicated by the department,"" the source said, referring to the European Commission's energy department.

Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said last week that it was a ""grey zone"" whether complying with Russia's payment scheme would breach sanctions, with no official ruling on the matter.

Draghi's office declined to comment on Friday.

In its written guidance, the EU said companies can buy Russian gas without breaching sanctions if they pay in the currency of their existing contracts - and declare that doing so fulfils their contractual obligations.

Most contracts EU firms have with Gazprom are in euros or dollars.

The guidance did not explicitly say, however, that opening rouble accounts for those payments to be converted into the Russian currency would be a breach of EU sanctions.

Katja Yafimava, senior research fellow at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, said there was no legal basis to suggest that opening a rouble account violated sanctions.

""There is nothing in the written guidance that prevents buyers from opening such accounts. While the European Commission verbal statements have created ambiguity, it is the written guidance that matters,"" she said.

National governments are responsible for enforcing EU sanctions, which were approved by all 27 member states.

Brussels could launch legal action against governments that fail to enforce them but member states disagree on gas payments.

Poland has demanded clearer advice from Brussels on whether companies can open rouble account.

A spokesperson for the Dutch economic affairs ministry said the country was lobbying for a clear EU stand, to ""draw one line for the whole EU"".

Brent futures for July delivery rose 51 cents, or 0.5%, to $112.55 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for June rose $1.02, or 0.9%, to settle at $113.23 on its on its last day as the front-month.

WTI notched its fourth straight week of gains, which it last did in mid-February. Brent gained about 1% this week after falling about 1% last week.


The more actively-traded WTI contract for July was up about 0.4% to $110.28 a barrel.

""The risks remain tilted to the upside ... given the Chinese reopening and continued efforts towards a Russian oil embargo by the EU,"" said Craig Erlam, a senior market analyst at OANDA.

In China, Shanghai did not signal any change to its planned end of a prolonged city-wide lockdown on June 1 even though the city announced its first new COVID-19 cases outside quarantined areas in five days. read more

The energy market expects the lifting of some coronavirus restrictions in Shanghai to boost energy demand. China is the world's top crude importer.

The EU is hoping to clinch a deal on a proposed ban of Russian crude imports which includes carve-outs for member states most dependent on Russian oil, such as Hungary. read more

""Odds of an EU embargo being declared sooner rather than later increased in the wake of Germany's success in cutting Russian oil imports by more than half in a very short period,"" consultancy BCA research said in a note.

German big business is drafting a plan to use an auction system to help ration available supplies in the event Russia cuts off its gas, although some fear it could punish smaller firms. read more

In the United States, U.S. energy firms this week added oil and natural gas rigs for a ninth week in a row, according to the Baker Hughes rig count, as mostly small producers respond to high prices and prodding by the government to ramp up output. read more

252,Analysis Musks ESG attack spotlights 35 trillion industry confusion,2022-05-20 19:00:16,"
LONDON/BOSTON, May 20 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's rejection of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) scores as a ""scam"" highlights how Wall Street's hottest investment trend that encompasses some $35 trillion in assets means different things to different people.

The chief executive of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) lashed out on Wednesday against S&P Global Inc (SPGI.N) after the electric car maker was dropped from its flagship ESG index while it added some companies whose activities are harmful to the environment, such as oil and gas producers.

Musk took to Twitter to express his frustration with the move ""despite Tesla doing more for the environment than any company ever!"" He added that ESG ""has been weaponized by phoney social justice warriors.""


S&P Dow Jones Indices senior director Margaret Dorn told Reuters that Tesla had been excluded from the index because its score declined slightly just as the scores of other automakers had improved. Tesla was not excluded because S&P executives decided to kick the company out of the index over a particular issue, she added. read more

While Tesla's cars contribute to lower carbon emissions, its ESG score had ""fallen behind"" in other aspects, such as poor working conditions at its U.S. Fremont factory, claims of racial discrimination and its handling of a U.S. government probe into multiple deaths and injuries linked to its autopilot technology.

Sustainable investing - taking into account ESG factors in portfolio selection - has exploded in recent years, reaching $35.3 trillion by the start of 2020, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance.

Half a dozen investment managers interviewed by Reuters said Musk's spat with S&P illustrates how confusion still reigns over how many investors and executives view the industry.

Some, like Musk, believe the ratings should reward companies that do the most for the planet and society. Others, including firms like S&P that produce the scores, say they are meant to show how much risk a company's stock faces from ESG factors.

This explains why some companies that are major contributors to climate change, such as Exxon Corp (XOM.N), are allowed to stay in an ESG index if they can show they are taking actions to reduce that risk.

""Ultimately ESG is a way of identifying and trying to quantify risk. So it's basically risk mitigation,"" said Chi Chan, portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. ""Effectively Musk is conflating ESG with sustainability.""

Mark Tinker, chief investment officer at Toscafund Hong Kong, said Musk ""rightly pointed out"" that societal and corporate governance considerations are being used ""for political driven cancelling"" and that a company's contribution to the environment can also ""mean what you want it to.""

""The whole thing is very subjective,"" Tinker said.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of the company or Musk.

S&P published the change in its ESG index on April 22. But it was not until May 18, a day after Horn wrote a blog post that explained why Tesla was excluded from the index, that Twitter users started disseminating it, catching Musk's attention.

Only a tiny fraction of the ESG's industry's assets under management - $11.7 billion as of the end of 2020 - are tied to S&P Indexes. S&P's influential ESG index rival MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) has so far kept Tesla in its bluechip ESG index.

It was not immediately clear if the exclusion from the S&P ESG index had any impact on Tesla's shares this week. The stock had already been sliding almost every day since early April, losing close to 40% of its value, amid concerns that China's COVID-19-related lockdowns will disrupt Tesla's car production and a potential economic slowdown and raging inflation will dampen demand for its vehicles. read more

Uncertainty over whether Musk will complete his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) has also weighed on Tesla's stock.

SCORE BREAKDOWN

S&P declined to provide a breakdown of its ESG score of Tesla, which is compiled based on scores of the company's various operations and practices.

MSCI also declined to provide a breakdown, but a May 3 copy of its Tesla rating sent to investors and reviewed by Reuters shows how its perceived poor performance on social issues took some of the shine out of the company's strong green credentials.

Tesla scored 9.1 out of 10 on environmental grounds, against an industry average of 6.5. This made up 30% of its total ESG score. On social issues, however, it ranked 1.4 compared with an average of 3.5, while on governance it scored 5.1 against an average of 3.2.

Andrew Poreda, senior vice president for Sage Advisory Services, an Austin-based investment firm, said as a Tesla investor he understood why the company's ESG scores were lower than they might have been based solely on the company's contribution in the fight against climate change.

""You can't live in a vacuum of just environmental or just social issues, they are all intertwined,"" Poreda said.

253,Russia makes early debt payment dash to dodge default,2022-05-20 17:27:08,"
Summary Moscow was due to pay $100 mln on two Eurobonds on May 27

U.S. OFAC license is due to expire on May 25

Russia has $40 bln in international bonds outstanding

Debt payments due until year end are less than $2 bln

LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - Russia rushed forward two payments on its international debt on Friday in its latest attempt to stave off a default that has looked on cards since its invasion of Ukraine.

A week before the interest payments are due and just five days before a key U.S. waiver allowing such transfers expires, Russia's finance ministry said it had wired $71.25 million for a dollar-denominated bond and 26.5 million euros ($28 million) for euro-denominated notes . read more

Russia has faced the prospect of sovereign default since Western capitals imposed sweeping sanctions in the wake of its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24. The country has been all but cut off from the global financial system and has seen roughly half of its $640 billion reserves abroad frozen.


Russia, which has retaliated with some counter-measures of its own, has been able to keep paying until now because of a special licence from the U.S. Treasury,which allows international bond holders to receive these kinds of payments.

That exemption is due to run out on May 25,however, and U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen signalled this week that it won't be extended. read more

""They are kicking the can down the road,"" said Kaan Nazli at asset managers Neuberger Berman, who holds some Russian sovereign bonds.

The country's $40 billion of international bonds, around half of which are held by foreign investors, have emerged as a flashpoint in recent months.

While Russia initially seemed keen to withhold payments to foreign investors unless it was allowed to make use of its frozen reserves abroad, this seems to have changed.

""The strategy turned into Russia not wanting to be the party to blame for the default,"" said Nazli.

According to the finance ministry, Russia's national settlement depository - which acts as a payment agent on the two bonds - had received the funds.

It was unclear if the funds would reach foreign holders of the two Russian Eurobonds, a multistep process that usually involves international banks and clearing houses.

JPMorgan, which previously acted as a correspondent bank on such payments, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Treasury declined to comment.

Russian Finance Minister Anton Siluanov said on Wednesday that Moscow would service its external debt obligations in roubles if the United States blocks other options and would not call itself in default as it had the means to pay. read more

Russia default fears slam bond prices

EXPIRING LICENCE

Despite the plethora of curbs, Russia has managed to make payments on seven bonds since its invasion of Ukraine before the latest interest payments.

But it seems increasingly unlikely that the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) will extend the licence Russia needs to make the payments. Treasury Secretary Yellen said on Wednesday that while no final decision had been taken, it was ""unlikely that it would continue."" read more

Those in support of an extension argue that allowing Russia to service its debt would drain its war chest by forcing Moscow to use its hard-currency revenues to make payments to creditors.

Opponents say Russia has to pay less than $2 billion on its external debt until the end of the year, which pales compared with Moscow's oil and gas revenue of almost $28 billion in April alone thanks to high energy prices.

The next payments after the May 27 one are $235 million across two Eurobonds due on June 23.

""This is delaying the inevitable,"" said Petar Atanasov, co-head of sovereign research at Gramercy, a specialist emerging market debt fund. ""At some point they will not be able to make the payments anymore.""

254,HMbacked project pilots CO2capturing aprons at Stockholm restaurant,2022-05-20 16:34:34,"
The textile industry has a large carbon footprint, something fashion giants are under increasing pressure to address as shoppers become more aware of the environmental impact of clothes and as global temperatures rise.

The Hong Kong Research Institute of Textiles and Apparel (HKRITA) has developed an amine-containing solution with which to treat cotton - fibre, yarn or fabric - making the cotton pull carbon dioxide gas towards it and capture it, to thereafter stabilise and store it on the surface of the textile.


HKRITA CEO Edwin Keh said in an interview his team had been inspired by techniques used in chimneys of coal-fired power plants to limit emissions.

""Many power plants have to scrub as much carbon dioxide as they can out of the air before the exhaust is released,"" Keh told Reuters. ""We thought 'why don't we try to replicate that chemical process on a cotton fibre"".

A T-shirt is able to absorb about a third of what a tree absorbs per day, Keh said. ""The (capturing) capacity isn't super high but this is quite inexpensive to produce and quite easy, and we think there are a lot of potential applications.""

REUTERS/Philip O'Connor Read More

The aprons in the pilot were produced at a H&M supplier in Indonesia, using the factory's existing equipment for the treatment, Keh said. ""It is a fairly simple chemical process.""

In the pilot the aprons are after use heated to 30-40 degrees Celsius at which temperature they release the CO2 - into a greenhouse where the gas is taken up by plants.

H&M Foundation said the innovation could potentially be a game changer in the reduction of global CO2 emissions.

Projects to develop CO2 absorbing textiles are however at an early stage, and their potential contribution to lessening the environmental impact of the textile industry remains to seen.

Keh said the institute would now develop its technology further, and try to find other uses for it, as well as other ways to use or dispose of the captured CO2.

HKRITA, which is part-financed by the philanthropic arm of Swedish fashion retailer H&M (HMb.ST), has developed a number of innovations aimed at making fashion more sustainable. One that has reached industrial scale use is a technique to separate cotton and polyester fibres in blend-textiles.

255,Canada finance minister defends Bank of Canada amid opposition attacks,2022-05-20 15:41:27,"
OTTAWA, May 20 (Reuters) - Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland on Friday defended the central bank as inflation spikes to a three-decade high and the frontrunner to take over the opposition Conservative Party pledges to fire the Bank of Canada governor if elected.

""It is clear to us all that we are living through a period of global volatility. We have COVID. We have the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We have China's zero-COVID policy,"" Freeland told reporters by teleconference from Munich, Germany after a G7 meeting.

""In this environment, responsible political leadership means reinforcing for Canadians, and for the world, our government's very clear commitment to the independence of the Bank of Canada and our confidence in the Bank of Canada.""


Pierre Poilievre, who leads in all polls ahead of a September vote to elect a new Conservative leader, has said he would turf Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem ""to get inflation under control"" if he becomes prime minister.

Inflation inched up to 6.8% in April, with food price growth hitting a four decade high, upping the pressure on the central bank to hike interest rates quickly to avoid an inflationary spiral. read more

Separately, Canada said on Friday it was imposing additional sanctions on Russian oligarchs and banning trade in certain luxury goods with Russia in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. read more

Freeland also told reporters the G7 had broadly discussed ""further strengthening"" sanctions against Russia, including the question of an oil and gas embargo.

""We absolutely recognize that the economic challenge of an oil and gas embargo is much greater for our European partners,"" she said, adding the group had discussed ways Canada could support Europe on energy security.

256,Analysis Fearing Russian cutoff German industry braces for gas rations race,2022-05-20 12:34:55,"
Summary

Summary Companies BDI lobby to present plan to government in early June

Split emerges between big and smaller companies

Auctions could be modelled on those for phasing out coal

FRANKFURT, May 20 (Reuters) - German big business is drafting a plan to use an auction system to help ration available supplies in the event Russia cuts off its gas, although some fear it could punish smaller firms.

Discussions on possible rationing have gathered urgency after Russia halted gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland last month.

That heightened concerns the same will happen to Germany, which is heavily dependent on Russian gas and is approaching a deadline this month to pay for the fuel under a rouble scheme demanded by Moscow.


Adding to nervousness, Russia's Gazprom (GAZP.MM) has told Finland it will halt gas supply from Saturday, Finnish state-owned gas wholesaler Gasum said. read more

Helsinki is seeking to end decades of neutrality by joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization whose enlargement Moscow opposes.

An action plan prepared by Germany's Bundesnetzagentur (BNetzA), which would be in charge of rationing in a gas supply emergency, explores which companies should get priority.

""Depending on the seriousness of the shortages ... it could be necessary ... to cut supply of gas to some users to zero,"" it said this week.

Regulators, it said, could delay gas cuts for industry if the agency determined that a company played a ""exceptional role"", although that has yet to be clearly defined.

BNetzA president Klaus Mueller has said several criteria would be taken into account when determining gas rationing for industry, including the size of the company, the relevance of the sector and potential economic losses.

German industry is particularly anxious about energy-intensive factories, such as glass, steel, food or drug manufacturing, as well as the chemicals sector, that provide many of the building blocks for industry.

Some in industry say the regulator will struggle to establish a coherent rationing list because manufacturing supply chains are intertwined and knock-on effects difficult to predict.

HIGHER PAIN THRESHOLDS

To try to gain control of the situation, proposals by the Federation of German Industries (BDI), which will be outlined to Germany's network regulator in early June, back the idea of an auction-style system.

The state would reimburse companies if they cut gas consumption by stopping production temporarily or longer term, leaving more for critically relevant sectors, said an industry source close to the matter, who asked not to be named.

Another source said this model would seek to distribute gas on the basis of price. Details were still being worked out.

Germany's small and medium-sized firms, under the umbrella of the 'mittelstand' BVMW lobby group, however, are alarmed at the idea of using the scheme to cope with gas rationing.

""To auction gas rights is not fair,"" Hans-Juergen Voelz, the group's chief economist, saying such a scheme could shut medium-sized companies.

""Big, financially strong companies have a much higher pain threshold in such auctions than a mittelstand company.""

Network regulator chief Mueller said last week that auctions for gas rationing could make sense.

Already Germany has such a system to try to wean the country off coal.

Utilities place bids for compensation payments they will get in exchange for idling coal-fired power stations.

Companies willing to accept the lowest price in return for shutting down qualify for the state handout, leaving larger power stations, with more at stake, up and running.

257,Finland leases floating LNG terminal for 10 years to break free from Russian gas,2022-05-20 11:51:33,"
HELSINKI, May 20 (Reuters) - Finland has agreed a 10-year charter for a floating storage and regasification (FSRU) vessel with U.S. based Excelerate Energy (EE.N) to help replace Russian gas supply, finance minister Annika Saarikko said on Friday.

""The LNG terminal will make it possible for us to break free from Russian gas,"" Saarikko said in a statement.

The announcement coincided with Finland's state-owned energy group Gasum saying Russia's Gazprom Export had informed it that natural gas supplies from Russia to Finland would be cut on Saturday 21 May at 04.00 GMT. read more


Last Friday, Finland's emergency preparedness committee said it was ready to cope in the event that Russia cuts off its supply of natural gas. read more

Finland and Estonia announced in April their intention to jointly charter a floating terminal for importing liquefied natural gas (LNG), a globally traded commodity, to help replace current deliveries of Russian gas. read more

Saarikko said the aspiration was to have the vessel, which will be located on the Southern coast of Finland, operational in the fourth quarter of this year.

""The total cost of the LNG terminal vessel project with the 10-year lease is estimated to be at 460 million euros ($487 million), in addition to which there are separate costs associated with the volume of use,"" Gasgrid Finland said, adding it was in talks with Estonian Elering on their participation.

The floating terminal will be managed by gas system operators Gasgrid Finland and Elering, with the Finnish partner to bear 80% of the rental costs, they said previously.

The vessel has a volume corresponding to about 68,000 tonnes of LNG when full, equally about 1,050 GWh of energy and it will be loaded with LNG around two to three times a month, Gasgrid Finland said.

""With more than 5 billion cubic metres a year in regasification capacity, Exemplar (the vessel) can easily cover Finland and Estonia's combined gas consumption and have much more left over,"" Excelerate's Chief Executive Steven Kobos told reporters.

The company saw its share climb 3.4% $25 in the U.S. premarket on the news.

""The LNG terminal ship will play a major role in securing gas supplies for Finland's industry,"" Finland's minister of economic affairs Mika Lintila said in a statement.

258,Rouble hits 2015 level against euro as EU prepares to pay for gas,2022-05-20 10:26:55,"
Summary

Summary Companies Rouble rallies sharply

Hits strongest since June 2015 vs euro

Sberbank CIB says selling gas for roubles behind rally

Further rouble firming not welcomed by budget

May 20 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble rallied to its strongest levels against the euro and dollar since June 2015 and March 2018 respectively on Friday, which analysts attributed to EU countries preparing to pay Russia for gas and to capital controls imposed by Moscow.

Russia said on Thursday that half of gas giant Gazprom's 54 clients have opened accounts at Gazprombank, as European companies approach imminent deadlines to pay for their gas supplies. read more

Opening such accounts became possible after EU executives allowed member states to keep buying Russian gas without breaching the slew of sanctions they have collectively imposed on Russia over what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine that started on Feb. 24.


One of the main reasons for the rouble rally is the switch to roubles from euros that will take place in European payments for Russian gas, said Yuri Popov, a strategist at SberCIB Investment Research, a unit of Russia's No.1 lender Sberbank (SBER.MM).

At 0807 GMT the rouble had firmed more than 5% to 61.10 against the euro in volatile trade on the Moscow Exchange after touching 59.02, its strongest since June 2015.

Against the dollar, it added more than 4% on the day to 59.10 after hitting 57.0750, a level not seen since late March 2018.

The rouble has firmed around 30% to the dollar this year despite a full-scale economic crisis in Russia, making it the best-performing currency, albeit artificially supported by controls imposed in late February to shield Russia's financial sector after it sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.

The rouble is being partly driven by export-focused companies that are obliged to convert their foreign currency revenue after Western sanctions froze nearly half of Russia's gold and forex reserves.

""Exporters are forced to sell (foreign currency) and there is no one to buy it,"" a trader at an investment company in Moscow said.

Preparations for month-end taxes due next week have also boosted demand for roubles, while demand for dollars and euros remains low due to disrupted imports chains and restrictions on withdrawing foreign currency from bank accounts and moving it out of Russia.

""The key question is whether the central bank will step in as the excessive rouble firming is not in the finance ministry's and budget' plans,"" Evgeny Suvorov, an analyst at CentroCreditBank, said.

Kirill Tremasov, the head of the central bank's monetary policy department, said on Friday that the rouble remained a free-floating currency, RIA news agency reported.

The central bank declined to comment on the rouble rate.

INFLATION BRAKE

Outside the Moscow Exchange, the rouble remained much weaker. Sberbank was selling cash dollars for 68.83 roubles and euros for 71.24 roubles.

A stronger rouble will help put a brake on inflation and is beneficial for importers, but it hurts those who sell goods and services abroad for foreign currency, meaning reduced incomes for Russia's export-dependent budget.

Analysts say Russian authorities are not interested in a substantial rouble strengthening from current levels and expect the currency to weaken by the end of the year.

In a sign that the authorities are ready to gradually lift capital controls, the central bank allowed banks to sell people's foreign currency without any restrictions from May 20, with the exception of U.S. dollars and euros.

Meanwhile, Russian stock indexes were mixed on Friday.

The dollar-denominated RTS index (.IRTS) rose 2.6% to 1,278.9 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index (.IMOEX) was 1.4% lower at 2,402.9 points, pressured by the rouble's appreciation.

259,Take Five Surging inflation recession risk and tanking markets,2022-05-20 09:18:35,"
Meeting minutes from the world's foremost policy makers may shed some light, while New Zealand and South Korean central banks ponder how big their rate hikes need to be to keep up with the Fed. And Washington holds the key to a Russian sovereign default as a key deadline approaches.

Here's your look at the week ahead from Ira Iosebashvili in New York, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo and Dhara Ranasinghe, Saikat Chatterjee and Karin Strohecker in London.


1/ FED THINKING

Can the Federal Reserve tame the worst U.S. inflation in decades without dragging the economy into a recession? The bank's meeting minutes on May 25 will offer clues.

Chair Jerome Powell is confident the Fed can achieve a ""soft landing"" -- words that are little solace to equity markets as recession warnings from big Wall Street banks pile up. Having raised rates by 75 basis points since March, the Fed is expected to hike another 50 bps in July. read more

Powell has vowed to raise rates as high as needed to tame inflation. The minutes will show how tenacious policy makers expect inflation to be and whether growth is resilient enough to face much tighter monetary policy. read more

2/ A BEAR HUG

Wall Street is melting. Major stock market indexes are in the grip of bear market territory with S&P 500 (.SPX) down some 19%, the high flying Nasdaq has lost more than a quarter from a November 2021 peak. And there's no respite in sight: Barclays and Goldman predict further pain for equities as corporate margins suffer from surging inflation. read more

The selloff is widespread. Since the bond bull market peak in March 2020, a constant duration 30-year U.S. Treasury bond lost half its value, safe-haven gold is down 6% this quarter. Surging volatility means even hardened stock pickers are reluctant to take big bets. read more

Retail and institutional investors are also bearish. A U.S. retail investment sentiment index is close to a March 2009 low while fund managers are running their highest cash levels since September 2011. read more

3/ PIVOT POINT

Forward-looking Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) data from the United States, Australia, Britain, Japan and euro area is worth paying attention to. And more so than usual with central banks caught between surging inflation and its impact on consumers amid a darkening growth outlook, hurt by China's COVID-lockdowns and war in Ukraine.

China bounced back quickly from an initial 2020 pandemic slump thanks to bumper exports and factory production, but the current downturn could be harder to shake off. read more

Entrenched in their inflation fight, policymakers may reach a pivot point in coming months where they have little choice but to focus on recession risk. PMIs have held up well recently, but might show how close that turning point is. read more

They were early movers, but the race is on for central banks in New Zealand and Korea to stay ahead of a Fed hot on their heels with some big-step hikes. read more

The Reserve Bank of New Zealand is widely seen raising rates by a half point again on Wednesday to tame inflation though risks to the economy are rising with recent homebuyers feeling the pain of higher mortgage rates. read more

Korea's new central bank governor roiled markets by flagging a half point increase before his maiden meeting on Thursday. Falling behind the curve could squeeze the fragile won, sending imported food and energy prices soaring. read more

The prospect of a Russian sovereign default is back given a deadline for a U.S. license allowing Moscow to make payments expiring on May 25 and $100 million in interest payments due a couple of days after. read more

Russia's $40 billion of sovereign bonds are just one of the flashpoints after its invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24 sparked sweeping sanctions and counter measures from Moscow.

Also pressing, is whether gas will keep flowing to Europe as firms struggle to confirm how they can legally buy gas if they have to pay in roubles with payments due from May 20. The EU has advised companies against opening rouble accounts but stopped short of saying that this would breach its sanctions against Moscow. Russia supplies around 40% of the EU's gas. read more

260,Oil prices end with gains on concerns over tight supply,2022-05-20 15:19:00,"Oil futures erased early weakness to end with a small gain Friday, though upside appeared to be limited by a sharp stock-market selloff.

Crude scored weekly gains, with WTI up 2.5% and Brent rising 0.9%, based on front-month contracts.

“Crude oil remains rangebound, caught between focusing on tight monetary policy driving an economic slowdown and a tightening global fuel-product market,” said Ole Hansen, head of commodity strategy at Saxo Bank, in a note to clients.

He added that it’s a situation that could get worse once China manages to lift lockdowns which has battered its economy and cut demand for commodities overall. Crude got a boost earlier in the week after the world’s biggest oil importers began easing up on its Shanghai lockdown.

But a turn south by equities pressured crude into negative territory and likely limited upside gains, analysts said. The downturn saw the S&P 500 SPX, -0.46% trade more than 20% below its record close from early January, a level that would mark a bear market if losses hold.

“Hard for crude oil to hold on to gains when S&P 500 demand indicator goes sour,” said Robert Yawger, executive director of energy futures at Mizuho Securities, in a note.

That was on display Wednesday, he noted, when a very bullish storage report from the Energy Information Administration still saw crude fall 2.5% as the S&P 500 tumbled 4%.

See: The S&P 500 is trading in bear-market territory. How far could it fall?

Natural-gas futures fell Friday but held on to a weekly gain of 5.5%.

Hansen noted that prices of the commodity are 200% higher versus a year ago, owing to record exports via LNG, flat production growth and a recent U.S. heat wave in the southern belt.

He said a weekly injection of 89 billion cubic feet (bcf) to 1732 bcf was in line with expectations and helped trim the deficit to the 5-year average of 15.2%.

Oil-field-services company Baker Hughes on Friday said the number of U.S. oil rigs rose by 13 this week to 576, while one gas rig was added, bringing the total to 150; miscellaneous rigs were unchanged at 2.

261,Revenge travel started in 2021 but its really coming back with a vengeance in Summer 2022,2022-05-20 14:17:00,"The term “revenge travel” became a popular way to describe consumers dusting off their itineraries shelved by the pandemic, but 2022 is poised to be an even bigger payback to those dog days of 2020.

That’s because travel and all its incidental spending is back with a vengeance even compared to last year, according to new Mastercard findings — perhaps a surprise for some during a time of decades-high inflation.

There will be 1.5 billion more passengers across the world flying this year compared to 2021 if flight bookings keep ascending at their current trajectory, Mastercard MA, +0.57% said, using data estimates with a global scope. That figure includes the revival of business travel, as more companies put a premium on in-person meetings and weekly face-to-face work schedules.

The projection includes approximately 365 million more people in the U.S., Canada and Mexico who are likely to take to the skies this year compared to last year, Mastercard added.

“‘No one is simply returning to who they were in February 2020.’” — Researchers from market-research firm Destination Analysts

Bookings on short- and medium-haul trips have surpassed pre-pandemic levels by more than one-quarter, while bookings for the longest-range trips are just below 2019 levels after being way behind at the start of 2022.

A shorter trip would be up to approximately 1,200 miles away and a mid-length trip would be up to approximately 2,600 miles respectively.

In April, people paid an average $358 for a U.S. domestic trip, a 41% year-over-year increase, and $865 for an international flight, a 22% rise, according to Hopper, a platform to shop for airline tickets.

While inflation data shows the overall cost of living increased 0.3% from March to April, the month-to-month increase for airfares was a record 18.6%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

When people arrive at their destination, they are ready to spend on good food, drink and the ingredients for good memories: Global tourist spending on “experiences,” such as restaurants and concerts, is 34% higher than 2019 levels.

They’ve been spending more on “things” like souvenirs since summer 2021, Mastercard said. (Credit-card companies obviously have a vested interest in people traveling and feeling confident about spending money this year.)

New destinations

Destination Analysts, a market-research firm for the tourism industry, polled 4,000 U.S. adults from March 15 to 23, 2022, and found a similar wanderlust among prospective travelers.

More than half (55.7%) say they prefer to go to places they have not been to before— up over 8 points over the previous month. “No one is simply returning to who they were in February 2020,” the researchers said.

American travelers are especially thirsty for experiences. As of April, they have shelled out almost 23% more in spending on the category compared to 2019 levels, Mastercard data showed.

“Travelers say they’re making up for lost time post-COVID.”

Two in ten people are planning domestic travel in the coming three months and 12% have international trips coming, according to the Mastercard survey. Just over half (54%) said they are looking forward to “make up” trips following two years of crimped, or no travel.

Some of the international destinations with the sharpest influxes of American tourists include the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and other Caribbean-region countries — places where COVID-19 regulations may be less strict than other destinations, Mastercard said.

The Mastercard findings align with other research forecasting a summer travel season where high costs will not melt many plans.

Around 30% of people say they are getting ready to spend more this summer, and 22% say it’s going to be at least $1,000 more than their typical budget, according to a CreditKarma survey on Thursday.

Putting aside inflation and record-breaking gas prices, one-third said they are paying more because they want to “make up for lost time.” Another reason was getting back to normal life (38%) and 25% cited the “fear of missing out.”

262,Russia is about to cut off Finlands natural gas,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"London (CNN Business)Russia is about to cut off natural gas supplies to a third European country that refuses to accept the Kremlin's demand for payment in rubles. 
Russian gas will stop flowing to Finland at 7 a.m. local time on Saturday, Finnish state gas company Gasum said in a statement Friday. Poland and Bulgaria were cut off in late April because they did not make payments in the Russian currency — a move EU leaders described at the time as ""blackmail"" by Moscow.
""It is highly regrettable that natural gas supplies under our supply contract will now be halted,"" Gasum CEO Mika Wiljanen said, adding that the company has been ""carefully preparing for this situation.""  
Earlier this week, Gasum said it was preparing for Russia to turn off the taps after it refused to meet President Vladimir Putin's demand that ""unfriendly"" countries pay for gas in rubles, rather than the euros or dollars stated in their contracts.
Finland on Sunday formally announced its intention to join NATO, ditching decades of neutrality and ignoring Russian threats of possible retaliation in a bid to strengthen its security following the onset of the war in Ukraine. 
Russian state gas giant Gazprom did not immediately respond to CNN Business when asked for comment. 
Finland relied on Russia for nearly 68% of its natural gas consumption in 2020, according to the International Energy Agency.
But Russia's gas exports account for just 3% of the Nordic nation's total energy mix — which includes energy generated from biofuels and nuclear sources — according to data from Eurostat and the European Network of Transmission System  Operators for Gas.  
Wiljanen said that Gasum ""will be able to supply all [of its] customers with gas in the coming months"" provided there are no disruptions to the gas transmission network, but added that the winter would be ""challenging.""
Gasum Vice President Olga Väisänen told CNN on Friday that Finland is also receiving gas through its Baltic connection via Estonia. The pipeline connects Finland's gas transmission network to Estonia's, and allows it to draw on underground storage in Latvia. 

Gazprom has told customers that they must open two accounts with Gazprombank — one in euros and the second in rubles, from which payments for the gas would be made.
Since then, EU officials, national governments and energy companies have been scrambling to figure out whether the new payment mechanism contravenes sanctions on Russia.
There is still much confusion. Some of Europe's energy giants have started the process of opening new accounts. Italian energy giant Eni  (E)said on Tuesday that it planned to open two accounts with Gazprombank, one in euros and another in rubles. 
But the European Commission insists that guidance it issued last week prohibits buyers opening a ruble account. EU Commission Chief Spokesperson Eric Mamer said at a Tuesday press briefing that such a move would breach sanctions. 
""Anything that goes beyond opening an account in the currency of the contract with Gazprombank and making a payment to that account, and then issuing a statement saying that... you have finalized the payment, contravenes the sanctions,"" he said. 
Some countries urgently need a solution as bills fall due. Germany, the bloc's biggest economy, relies heavily on Russian gas to power its homes and industries, though it has managed to slash Russia's share of its imports to 35% from 55% before the start of the war. 
Earlier this week, the EU said it would spend €210 billion ($222 billion) to wean itself off Russian oil and gas. 
Its ""REPowerEU"" plan aims to reduce its consumption of Russia's gas by 66% before the end of this year — and to break its dependence completely before 2027 — by saving energy, finding alternate sources and speeding up the transition to renewables.

263,Bank of Englands Pill sees need for further interest rate rises,2022-05-20 08:19:59,"
LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - The Bank of England will need to raise interest rates further to combat the risk of self-perpetuating price rises, the central bank's chief economist, Huw Pill, said on Friday.

Pill said the central bank was battling the biggest inflation challenge since it gained operational independence in 1997, with inflation at a 40-year high of 9.0% and set to hit double digits later this year.

While inflation in the short-term was driven by factors such as geopolitical conflict, surging energy prices and supply-chain bottlenecks which the BoE could not control, he said it needed to ensure expectations of high inflation did not become entrenched.


""Avoiding any drift towards the embedding of such 'inflationary psychology' into the price-setting process is crucial,"" Pill said in a speech to Wales's Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.

""Tightening still has further to run,"" he added.

Earlier this month the BoE said ""some degree of further tightening in monetary policy may still be appropriate in the coming months"" - although two members of its Monetary Policy Committee reckoned this guidance was too aggressive.

The BoE has raised interest rates four times since December - more than any other major central bank - and financial markets expect rates to reach 2% by the end of the year from 1% now.

BoE forecasts earlier this month showed inflation in three years' time was on course to significantly undershoot its 2% target, as the economy slows and energy prices stabilise.

But Pill indicated this should not automatically be read as a signal that the BoE thought market rate expectations were excessive.

""I want to flag some reasons for caution in how to interpret our published inflation forecasts as guides to the validity of the interest rate profiles on which they are conditioned,"" he said.

For example, these forecasts did not capture the impact of a potential future European embargo on Russian oil and gas, he said.

264,3 Takeaways From Morningstars Conference for Fund Managers,2022-05-20 14:15:00,"It’s a tough time to be an investor. And the bad news keeps coming: Interest rates are rising, inflation is high, the war in Ukraine continues, China’s woes are deepening, and stocks and crypto are both crashing.

With turbulence and uncertainty writ large on the global stage, investors and financial advisors gathered in Chicago to discuss the outlook for markets and investing and where to find bargains. Here are three key points from the Morningstar Investment conference:

Love it or hate it, Bitcoin is here to stay

Last week, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunged, regaining a bit of ground this week. So what is the future of cryptocurrency?

Mark Casey, portfolio manager at Capital Group, said he has a paradoxical view. “Every project I studied in crypto seems like garbage to me, and it doesn’t really have a real reason to exist, other than Bitcoin, which I think could turn out to be one of the most important inventions in all of human history,” he said.

While he is optimistic about Bitcoin, he acknowledged that it is still in its early days. “I think it’s a very early invention. It’s very speculative and it could fail,” Casey said. At the same time, he added, “it’s a profoundly significant invention. I think it could be a big deal in the long term.”

As for where Bitcoin will trade in the future, Christopher Lin, portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments, said no one “has any clue of what the price of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is going to do over the next 1- 3- 5- 10 years with any sort of precision or accuracy.”

He said he is neither bullish nor bearish, “because that implies that I know what the price is going to do. I have no idea what the price is going to do. But I think the technology is extremely elegant and could be extraordinarily valuable as an evolution of software computing.”

Opportunities abound for ESG investors

The costs for clean energy solutions were “abysmal as recently as 10 years ago,” said Lucas White, portfolio manager at GMO. The technologies were so uncompetitive that they were only in use thanks to public policy support. Now, transformational changes in areas such as auto manufacturing, utilities, and water have created a heap of opportunities that no longer rely on government aid, he said.

While greenhouse-gas emissions grab most of the headlines when it comes to climate change, water is a looming risk for businesses and investors. Lisa Beauvilain, head of sustainability and ESG at Impax Asset Management, said water “is very important for climate solutions” because it “will be the manifestation of climate in many ways, too much, or too little.”

She looks at investing in water through three lenses: infrastructure, including pipes, valves and pumps; water treatment and recycling; and water utilities.

Ukraine has already beaten Russia

“Ukraine has already won this war,” said former U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation Michael McFaul. “Putin has failed in all his major objectives but one.”

Those objectives include reunifying Russia and Ukraine; “denazifying” Ukraine through regime change; demilitarization; seizing the capital Kyiv; and occupying the major cities in the east. Only progress in the eastern Donbas region appears possible at this point.

“Now [Russia] is down to changing the military objectives,” McFaul said. “It’s the defense of Donbas, the independence of Donbas. [Putin] has moved everything there to try to connect Crimea to Donbas.”

Putin has lost “the big war …but that doesn’t mean yet that he’s lost all the battles,” McFaul said, adding that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is “the Churchill of our time.”

As for what happens next, he said there were two relatively unlikely outcomes:

“I think it’s a low probability that Putin wins Donbas and pushes up to Kyiv. It isn’t zero,” he said. “One other low probability, but not zero, is that the Ukrainians push the Russians out of their country. I think that is higher than the first one.”

The most probable outcome, McFaul said, is that the fight in Donbas lasts “for several weeks, maybe months, where the borders don’t change that much, and then there are some very hard decisions that especially President Zelensky will have to make. Does he sign a cease-fire and agree to disagree about the borders or do they continue to fight?”

265,Exclusive China quietly increases purchases of lowpriced Russian oil,2022-05-20 07:37:01,"
SINGAPORE, May 20 (Reuters) - China is quietly ramping up purchases of oil from Russia at bargain prices, according to shipping data and oil traders who spoke to Reuters, filling the vacuum left by Western buyers backing away from business with Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in February.

The move by the world's biggest oil importer comes a month after it initially cut back on Russian supplies, for fear of appearing to openly support Moscow and potentially expose its state oil giants to sanctions. read more

China's seaborne Russian oil imports will jump to a near-record 1.1 million barrels per day (bpd) in May, up from 750,000 bpd in the first quarter and 800,000 bpd in 2021, according to an estimate by Vortexa Analytics.


Unipec, the trading arm of Asia's top refiner Sinopec Corp (600028.SS), , is leading the purchases, along with Zhenhua Oil, a unit of China's defense conglomerate Norinco, according to shipping data, a shipbroker report seen by Reuters and five traders. Livna Shipping Ltd, a Hong Kong-registered firm, has also recently emerged as a major shipper of Russian oil into China, the traders said.

Sinopec declined comment. Zhenhua and Livna did not respond to requests for comment.

The firms are filling the hole left by western buyers after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which Russia calls a ""special military operation.""

The United States, Britain and some other key oil buyers banned imports of Russian oil shortly after the invasion. The European Union is finalizing a further round of sanctions, including a ban on Russian oil purchases. Many European refiners have already stopped buying from Russia for fear of running afoul of sanctions or drawing negative publicity.

Vitol and Trafigura, two of the world's biggest commodity traders, phased out purchases from Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil producer, ahead of an EU rule that came into effect on May 15 barring purchases unless ""strictly necessary"" to secure the EU's energy needs. read more

""The situation began taking a drastic turn after the exit of Vitol and Trafigura that created a vacuum, which could only be filled by companies that can provide value and are trusted by their Russian counterparts,"" one Chinese trader, who asked not to be named, told Reuters.

The low price of Russia's oil – spot differentials are about $29 less per barrel compared with before the invasion, according to traders - is a boon for China's refiners as they face shrinking margins in a slowing economy. The price is well below competing barrels from the Middle East, Africa, Europe and the United States. read more

China separately receives some 800,000 bpd of Russian oil via pipelines under government deals. That would bring May imports to nearly 2 million bpd, 15% of China's overall demand. For Russia, oil sales are helping to cushion the blow to its economy from sanctions.

STATE BUYERS

State-owned Chinese companies, led by Sinopec and Zhenhua, are set to buy two thirds of Russia's flagship Far Eastern export grade ESPO (Eastern Siberia–Pacific Ocean oil pipeline) blend in May, up from a third before the invasion of Ukraine, traders who closely monitor the flows told Reuters. Russia exported about 24 million barrels in May, 6% higher than April.

Sinopec alone is likely to buy at least 10 ESPO shipments in May, doubling its volume before the invasion, with some of the trades hitting a record discount of $20 a barrel below benchmark Dubai crude on FOB Kozmino basis, three of the traders said.

Sinopec, Zhenhua and Livna are moving more oil from both Russia's Baltic Sea ports in northwestern Europe and its Far East export hub Kozmino.

Zhenhua, the smallest state-owned Chinese oil trader, has chartered ships to move Russian oil, according to shipping data and traders with knowledge of the matter. North Petroleum International Co, a unit of Zhenhua, loaded two ESPO shipments in early May, and another two cargoes of Urals from Baltic Sea port Ust-Luga in late April and mid-May, according to data from Refinitiv and Vortexa, a shipbroker report and traders.

Norinco, one of the world's largest defence contractors, branched into oil more than two decades ago, winning a concession to produce oil in Iraq in the 1990s. Its trading vehicle Zhenhua recently expanded into gas terminal investment and trading. read more

Zhenhua has bought some of its supply of Russian oil via Switzerland-based Paramount Energy, a trader specializing in marketing oil from independent Russian and Kazakhstan producers to mostly private end-users, said two traders with knowledge of the matter.

A regular marketer of ESPO to China's independent refiners since 2016, Paramount Energy expanded its China business by boosting sales to Zhenhua after it set up a Beijing office in 2020, said the trading executives.

In response to Reuters' questions, Paramount Energy did not address trades made after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. It said it ""has customers in China for ESPO crude cargoes delivered under long-term contracts established well before Feb. 24,"" the date of the invasion. ""This crude is supplied exclusively by independent oil producers and non-state companies, as has long been our policy.""

Livna, which has not previously been a major player in taking Russian oil to Asia, has since late April loaded over 7 million barrels of Russian Urals and ESPO crude bound for China, according to ship-tracking data from Vortexa and Refinitiv.

Previously a regular shipper of Russia's Europe-focused export-grade Urals within Europe, Livna started sending Russian oil to Shandong province, China's independent refiners' hub, in early 2020, according to shipping data.

So far in May, Livna has loaded eight cargoes, or nearly 6 million barrels of ESPO oil, destined for China, up from one or two cargoes each month earlier in this year, shipping data showed. Livna also loaded at least two Urals shipments from Baltic ports in May for delivery to China, traders told Reuters.

The withdrawal of western traders has also attracted new player Shandong Port International Trade Group, a provincial government-backed trader to the business, traders told Reuters.

266,Experts suggest using WIC government benefits to get baby formula amid a nationwide shortage  but these frustrated parents say thats not a viable option,2022-05-20 13:03:00,"For two months, Kathryn Bauerle, 21, mom of 8-month-old Lori, has been scrambling to find baby formula.

Her town of Cleveland, Ga. immediately felt the squeeze of Abbott’s ABT, +0.10% formula recall in February.

But even before the recall, there was a nationwide baby-formula shortage due to supply-chain issues related to the pandemic. The recall made a tough situation worse.

Relief could be coming, but parents like Bauerle probably won’t feel it for more than a month. Abbott announced Monday that it had signed a consent decree with the Food and Drug Administration that details the steps necessary to resume production at the company’s Sturgis, Mich., plant. Once the FDA confirms that Abbott has taken the initial steps outlined, Abbott expects to have the plant up and running in about two weeks, and formula should hit store shelves in six to eight weeks after that.

“We are such a small town, as soon as the formula got recalled and production stopped, we couldn’t find anything for two months,” said Bauerle.

Around the same time, she received a letter responding to her application to enroll in the government’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) with a local office in Cleveland. She was denied.

The WIC program gives participants vouchers or checks every month to help pay for nutritious food, including baby formula, for low-income mothers and children.

Bauerle applied for WIC at the recommendation of her doctor, who suggested WIC could help her access baby formula. Amid the shortage, groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infant Nutrition Council of America and government agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services have been recommending WIC as a potential source of formula, but that advice has sometimes proven difficult to follow.

WIC benefits can’t be used to buy formula from online retailers like Amazon AMZN, +0.27% , and in many areas, WIC will only cover certain sizes of canned formula, so parents who can’t find that specific size are out of luck. The program is only open to certain income levels, and, more importantly, it’s been particularly hard hit by supply-chain issues and the Abbott recall. “More than 1.2 million infants receive formula benefits through WIC, and Abbott is the exclusive supplier for more than half of the WIC agencies nationwide,” said Brian Dittmeier, Senior Director of Public Policy at the National WIC Association.

WIC is federally funded, and states and counties operate the program on a local level. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers WIC, did not reply to a request for comment.

“‘We are such a small town, as soon as the formula got recalled and production stopped, we couldn’t find anything for two months.’” — Kathryn Bauerle, 21, mother of 8-month-old Lori

Bauerle’s doctor suggested that she should look into WIC for help finding formula last November, so she applied. It took a few months before she heard back that she had been denied, and she did not receive an explanation about why.

After doing some research, she and her husband thought the refusal may have been related to their household income. Bauerle was pregnant with Lori when she applied, so their household may have been counted as a two-person one.

For most states, aside from Alaska and Hawaii, participants in the WIC program cannot earn more than 185% of the federal poverty level. For a two-person household, the 2021-2022 level would be $32,227, and $40,626 for a three-person household.

Bauerle is a stay-at-home mom, and her husband works in pest control, and takes home around $33,000 a year.

“I wish that there wasn’t such a defined cutoff, I mean $30,000 a year only goes so far,” said Bauerle. For families that are “technically” living paycheck to paycheck, there should be more support, she added.

Bauerle said securing formula has turned into both a group effort with friends looking out for each other and a field trip that requires hours of driving.

The worst moments come when the uncertainty and fear of not being able to find anything kicks in, she said: “Laying in bed with my daughter, cuddling her to sleep at night, wondering if we’ll be able to find a formula for her, or worrying if she’s going to be OK.”

And this fear is growing: Bauerle is pregnant with her second child. She’s scared that if the baby-formula shortage continues, her situation will become even more dire.

After Bauerle was rejected from WIC, she talked to others who have succeeded or were already on WIC, but other moms advised her not to count on the program for help accessing baby formula, due to the nationwide shortage.

For now, Bauerle said she will need to pay out of pocket for baby formula.

She said she has heard it could take up to two months to get a WIC application approved, and because of an application backlog due to a surge of applications during the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s taking even longer.

It’s a Catch-22 for parents who are already on WIC: Some have reported that their baby formula benefits don’t help at all, because they couldn’t find the formula in stores.

On several public Facebook FB, +1.00% groups organized for parents looking for baby formula, WIC parents have complained that regardless of WIC, they are paying out-of-pocket for formula for their children, because they’re unable to make use of the benefits.

“I can’t use my WIC card, I’m paying out cash for it and I don’t know what to do anymore, ” said Kathleen Ariel Bonneville, 29, a first-time mom to a 5-month-old based in Willington, Conn. Bonneville wanted to breastfeed her son Jake, but said because she didn’t get the help or instruction she needed from her hospital on breastfeeding, she has used baby formula for her son. (Her hospital in Hartford, Conn. did not reply to a request for comment.)

Bonneville finds it increasingly hard to find formula in her area — she is disabled and takes medicine to help her focus. She doesn’t drive, so she needs help hunting down formula. Recently the hunt has become longer and longer. It took her almost a month to find a few cans on Monday morning in a Walgreens WBA, +0.69% in Stafford, Conn.

“Nobody is helping you. You call the doctor’s office for your son, and they can’t help you. You call WIC, and they can’t help you, and even though it says on the news to call your doctor’s office, they don’t help,” Bonneville said.

She added, “My child is my focus now and will always be.”

WIC programs in different states instruct parents to use a mobile app to find program-approved stores and that sell formula covered by WIC. For example, New York State uses WIC2Go, and Connecticut uses WICShopper.

For Bonneville to use her WIC card to find formula, she needs to check the approved stores on WICShopper. The app usually suggests a Walmart WMT, +0.15% , which has had nothing lately.

Once Bonneville found a 12.4-ounce can, but she couldn’t buy it with a WIC payment, because it wasn’t a size that is covered by WIC.

Currently, there are over 20 baby formula products covered by her WIC benefits, most of which are in larger sizes, she said. Bonneville said the options were recently expanded.

In some areas, WIC benefits only cover Abbott’s Similac formula. Ryan Folks, 34, a hair stylist and mom to an 8-month old girl, is facing that issue. The benefits from her local WIC office in Detroit, Mich. cover Abbott baby formula, all Similac — Similac Advance, Similac Sensitive and others. The program does cover other brands such as Nutramigen or Enfamil, both made by Mead Johnson RBGPF, +2.92% , but they are categorized as “Special Formulas” that require medical documentation.

The Biden administration last Friday urged states to expand the types of formula products covered by WIC amid the shortage. As Abbott has a contract with USDA, the government department on Friday asked the company to extend rebates until the end of August so that states and retailers can plan ahead and buy any products available to help with the on-going shortage. Abbott agreed.

After the Abbot recall, the WIC office Folks uses changed its authorized formula from powder to concentrate. Of the 24 products eligible for purchase with her WIC benefits, 16 were part of the recall, by her count.

Unused WIC benefits cannot be rolled over to the next month, and although her daughter can eat some food now, she must embark on “a field trip” to find formula. When talking to MarketWatch on Monday, she was trying to find money to buy a few cans off another person without WIC assistance.

“I didn’t like that they didn’t have backup plans for us,” Folks said.

267,Chinas April Saudi oil imports soar 38 over previous year Russian oil up 4,2022-05-20 05:44:49,"
Summary Saudi crude oil imports 2.17 mln bpd, +38% yr/yr

Russian oil 1.59 mln bpd, +4% yr/yr

Imports from Malaysia 2nd highest on record

LNG from Russia +80% yr/yr despite fall in total imports

May 20 (Reuters) - China's crude oil imports from top supplier Saudi Arabia soared 38% in April from a year earlier, hitting the highest monthly volume since May 2020, according to Reuters' calculations based on official Chinese customs data.

Saudi shipments amounted to 8.93 million tonnes last month, equivalent to 2.17 million barrels per day (bpd), according to data from the Chinese General Administration of Customs.

The hefty purchases, with trades completed mostly in February, compare with 1.61 million bpd in March and 1.57 million bpd a year earlier.


Imports from second-largest supplier Russia rose a more modest 4% last month from a year earlier, with cargoes booked before western governments toughened sanctions over Russia's invasion of Ukraine in late February.

Russian oil arrivals in April totalled 6.55 million tonnes, or 1.59 million bpd, data showed, up slightly from 1.5 million bpd in March and 1.53 million bpd a year earlier.

China's overall crude oil imports last month rose nearly 7% on the year, the first rise in three months, although widespread COVID-19 lockdowns crimped fuel demand and dampened refinery output. read more

Friday's data showed zero imports in April from Iran. However, customs next month is likely to report for May the import of nearly 2 million barrels of Iranian oil that was being discharged this week into a reserve base in south China.

Despite U.S. sanctions on Iran, China has kept taking Iranian oil, usually passed off as supplies from other countries. The import levels are roughly equivalent to 7% of China's total crude oil imports. read more

Iranian oil, often priced lower than competing grades, has squeezed out rival supplies from producers such as from Brazil and West Africa.

Customs reported zero imports from Venezuela, as state oil firms shunned purchases since late 2019 for fear of falling afoul of secondary U.S. sanctions.

Imports from Malaysia, often used as a transfer point in the last two years for oil originating from Iran and Venezuela, jumped 84% on year to 2.165 million tonnes, the second highest on record.

Separately, data also showed China's imports of Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) in April were up 80% from a year earlier to 462,975 tonnes, the highest monthly amount in six months, despite a sharp fall in the country's total imports of the fuel.

China's overall LNG imports last month slid 34.5% to 4.35 million tonnes, the slowest since March 2020 as importers shunned pricey global spot supplies.

Below is the detailed breakdown of oil imports, with volumes in million tonnes:

Bonds rally on safety appeal, dollar backs away from highs

NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - Global equities fell further on Thursday, unable to sustain a late rally on Wall Street, as investors dumped stocks on fears of sluggish growth and bought safe-haven assets such as government debt and the Swiss franc.

Some megacap growth stocks that have underperformed this year posted gains but the rally fizzled. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 0.75%, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 0.58% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 0.26%.

Big slides for Walmart on Tuesday and Target on Wednesday have demoralized investors who wonder about rising costs across the supply chain, said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.

""You got a pretty severe shock to the system for portfolio managers with the combination of those two,"" James said. ""That type of damage is hard to repair, piled on top of the extremely challenging year that technology investors have had,"" he said.

But James said there are those view market as being extremely oversold and ""you're due for some kind of a bounce.""

269,Bidens approval rating drops to lowest of presidency poll shows,2022-05-20 11:21:00,"President Joe Biden’s approval rating dipped to the lowest point of his presidency in May, a new poll shows, with deepening pessimism emerging among members of his own Democratic Party.

Only 39% of U.S. adults approve of Biden’s performance as president, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Research, dipping from already negative ratings a month earlier.

Overall, only about 2 in 10 adults say the U.S. is heading in the right direction or the economy is good, both down from about 3 in 10 a month earlier. Those drops were concentrated among Democrats, with just 33% within the president’s party saying the country is headed in the right direction, down from 49% in April.

Of particular concern for Biden ahead of the midterm elections, his approval among Democrats stands at 73%, a substantial drop since earlier in his presidency. In AP-NORC polls conducted in 2021, Biden’s approval rating among Democrats never dropped below 82%.

The findings reflect a widespread sense of exasperation in a country facing a cascade of challenges ranging from inflation, gun violence, and a sudden shortage of baby formula to a persistent pandemic.

“I don’t know how much worse it can get,” said Milan Ramsey, a 29-year-old high school counselor and Democrat in Santa Monica, California, who with her husband had to move into her parents’ house to raise their infant son.

Ramsey thinks the economic dysfunction that’s led to her being unable to afford the place where she grew up isn’t Biden’s fault. But she’s alarmed he hasn’t implemented ambitious plans for fighting climate change or fixing health care.

“He hasn’t delivered on any of the promises. I feel like the stimulus checks came out and that was the last win of his administration,” Ramsey said of Biden. “I think he’s tired — and I don’t blame him, I’d be tired too at his age with the career he’s had.”

Republicans have not been warm to Biden for a while. Less than 1 in 10 approve of the president or his handling of the economy, but that’s no different from last month.

Gerry Toranzo, a nurse and a Republican in Chicago, blames Biden for being forced to pinch pennies by taking steps like driving slower to conserve gas after prices have skyrocketed during his administration.

“His policies are destroying the economy,” Toranzo, 46, said of Biden, blaming him for stopping the Keystone XL fuel pipeline to Canada and hamstringing domestic energy production. “It’s a vicious cycle of price increases.”

Overall, two-thirds of Americans disapprove of Biden’s handling of the economy. That rating is largely unchanged over the last few months, though elevated slightly since the first two months of the year.

But there are signs that the dissatisfaction with Biden on the economy has deepened. Just 18% of Americans say Biden’s policies have done more to help than hurt the economy, down slightly from 24% in March. Fifty-one percent say they’ve done more to hurt than help, while 30% say they haven’t made much difference either way.

The percentage of Democrats who say Biden’s policies have done more to help dipped from 45% to 37%, though just 18% say they’ve done more to hurt; 44% say they’ve made no difference.

Some Democrats blame other forces for inflation.

Manuel Morales, an internet service technician in Moline, Illinois, thinks the pandemic and war in Ukraine have had a far bigger impact than Biden’s decisions. But the 58-year-old Democrat is now questioning the benefits of Biden’s biggest legislative achievement, the American Rescue Plan, and its stimulus checks.

“It helped a lot of people, but,” Morales said, “people did not want to go back to work.”

Morales faults Biden on another area of persistent vulnerability to the president — immigration.

Only 38% back Biden on immigration, and Morales is disappointed at the scenes of migrants continuing to cross the southern border. Though he himself is a Mexican immigrant, Morales thinks the U.S. needs to more stringently control its border to have a hope of legalizing deserving migrants who are in the country illegally.

Also, Morales said, there have to be limits. “It’s impossible to bring the whole of Central America and Mexico into this country,” he said.

Another area where Morales faults Biden, albeit mildly, is the war with Ukraine. “We are spending a lot of money going to the Ukraine and all that is going to the deficit,” Morales said.

Overall, 45% of Americans approve of Biden’s handling of the U.S. relationship with Russia, while 54% disapprove. That’s held steady each month since the war in Ukraine began. Seventy-three percent of Democrats and 15% of Republicans approve.

The new poll shows just 21% of Americans say they have “a great deal of confidence” in Biden’s ability to handle the situation in Ukraine; 39% say they have some confidence and 39% say they have hardly any.

Charles Penn, a retired factory worker in Huntington, Indiana, is satisfied with Biden’s performance on Ukraine.

“I think he’s done alright,” Penn, 68, said of the president.

But overall Penn, an independent who leans Republican, is disappointed with Biden, and blames him for rising prices that have squeezed him in his retirement.

“The Democrats, in the long run, have screwed up things by pushing for higher wages, like going from $7 an hour to $15 an hour,” Penn said, citing the push for a sharp increase in the federal minimum wage that Biden has embraced. “The other side of it is that if you had Republicans, they’d cut my Social Security.”

Still, Penn thinks Biden should pay the political price.

“He’s captain of the ship, so he’s responsible,” Penn said of the president.

270,Exxon to sell north Texas gas assets to BKV for 750 million,2022-05-19 20:39:04,"
May 19 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) on Thursday said it signed a deal to sell North Texas natural gas properties to producer BKV Corp for $750 million, as part of a wider move to shed unwanted assets.

Exxon, the top U.S. oil producer, set a goal three years ago to sell by last December $15 billion in assets to pay down debt and focus on lower cost oil production. But it has achieved about half its goal as sales stalled during the pandemic.

This year's rebound in oil and gas prices has brought renewed interest in its properties, Senior Vice President Neil Chapman told analysts in March.


North Texas assets sales include additional payments based on future gas prices, allowing the company to profit from rising fuel costs. The deal is expected to close by June 30.

“We are focused on delivering the most competitive returns to our shareholders by developing opportunities with the lowest cost of supply,” said Liam Mallon, president of Exxon Mobil Upstream Company.

Denver-based BKV is majority owned by Thai energy firm Banpu PCL (BANPU.BK) and is the largest natural gas producer in the Barnett Shale, an area of north Texas where the first shale wells were successfully drilled.

Exxon is offering assets in Asia, Africa and Europe as it as focuses on Guyana, offshore Brazil and the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. It is marketing assets in Iraq, Chad, Nigeria, Canada, and in Arkansas and Ohio.

The company, which suffered a historic $22.4 billion loss in 2020, has used this year's skyhigh oil prices to pay down debt and increase payouts to shareholders.

Exxon said it had removed the Barnett Shale assets operated by its subsidiaries XTO Energy Inc and Barnett Gathering LLC from its development plan in 2020.

Last year, it took in $2.6 billion from asset sales, up from $1 billion in 2020.

272,Oil rebounds from two days of losses in volatile trade,2022-05-19 19:06:57,"
Summary Europe still weighing ban on imports from Russia

U.S. dollar backs off recent gains, down 1%

NEW YORK, May 19 (Reuters) - Oil prices rebounded from two days of losses in a volatile session on Thursday, bolstered by weakness in the dollar and expectations that China could ease some lockdown restrictions that could boost demand.

Crude benchmarks continued their spate of wild swings, with both Brent and U.S. crude rising by nearly $5 a barrel in the span of a few hours, recovering from losses earlier in the week.

""The market has been extremely volatile,"" said Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates in Houston. ""The market is reacting to all sorts of different headlines hour to hour, and the movement in oil markets on a day-by-day basis getting even more exaggerated.""


Brent crude futures for July settled at $112.04, a gain of $2.93 a barrel, or 2.7%. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures for June settled up $2.62, or 2.4%, to $112.21 a barrel.

In China, investors are closely watching plans to ease coronavirus curbs from June 1 in the most populous city of Shanghai, which could lead to a rebound in oil demand from the world's top crude importer.

Oil markets also rebounded as the dollar weakened. The broad dollar index was down 1% on the day after recent gains. Oil benchmarks often move inversely to the dollar as most global crude transactions are handled in dollars, so a rising greenback makes crude more expensive for big importers.

Crude gains have been limited, however, with the Brent and U.S. benchmarks trading in a range due to the uncertain path of demand. Investors, worried about rising inflation and more aggressive action from central banks, have been reducing exposure to riskier assets.

""Brent seems pinned above $100 but I think the recession risk and all of the concerns about Chinese demand are limiting the upside and will continue to do that,"" said Bill Farren-Price, head of oil and gas macro research at Enverus in London.

The looming possibility of a European Union ban on Russian oil imports has been supporting prices. This month the EU proposed a new package of sanctions against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine, which Moscow calls a ""special military operation.""

That would include a total ban on oil imports in six months' time, but the measures have not yet been adopted, with Hungary among the most vocal critics of the plan. read more

273,The capitulation model for biotech is a Category 5 storm the same as energy in 2020  why contrarians say the sector is a buy,2022-05-20 10:34:00,"If you want to know how much investors hate the biotech sector right now, consider this simple statistic: More than 25% of small biotech companies have stock-market capitalizations that are smaller than how much they have in cash.

“The market is saying a quarter of these companies are literally worth nothing,” says Jefferies biotech analyst Michael Yee, who recently published this insight.

That’s remarkable. That 25% is the highest in 15 years — higher than even during the agonizingly long bear market of the 2008 financial crisis.

Back then, 18% traded below cash. From 2010 to 2020, the number bounced between 3% and 11%, according to Yee and his team. He’s referring to small- and medium-cap (smidcap) companies, those with a market cap of less than $5 billion. These are the ones that tend to have no earnings and have early-stage therapies in testing.

“This is the worst drawdown we have seen in our careers,” says biotech analyst Charmaine Chan with the Cambiar Opportunity Fund CAMOX, -0.32% . “No one has seen anything worse unless they have done this for over 20 years.”

For contrarians, this kind of extreme signal suggest only one thing. The sector is a buy. While it’s tough to find any biotech experts who are bullish on the group (even Yee is cautious), I’m not the only one looking at this as a contrarian opportunity.

Category 5 storm in biotech

The macro analyst Larry McDonald at The Bear Traps report has a similar view. To spot contrarian buy signals, McDonald tracks a collection of capitulation markers he developed during the 2008 crisis. They tell him when a sector is so despised that it is worth buying, in the contrarian sense. It’s a “blood in the streets” indicator, to borrow from the old Wall Street adage that says we should buy stocks when there’s blood in the streets. His capitulation gauge tracks several technical signals, among other things.

“The capitulation model for biotech is a Category 5 storm, the same as energy in 2020,” says McDonald. “The risk-reward is fantastic, at least for a countertrend bounce.”

Look at how the SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Exploration & Production exchange-traded fund XOP, +0.22% is up over 170% from its 2020 midpoint.

McDonald suggests the SPDR S&P Biotech XBI, +0.58% and iShares Biotechnology IBB, +0.11% ETFs. I suggest six individual stocks below with help from Yee and Chan. McDonald thinks the XBI could go up 20% to $83 in a shorter-term countertrend rally, and possibly rise 30% to $90 or more a year from now. Those targets are the 50- and 100-day moving averages.

Biotech experts disagree

People who know the space better than myself and McDonald aren’t on board. Yee, who has been cautious since last summer ahead of the big decline, thinks biotech will remain challenged for the year. “It will take a lot of time to heal these wounds,” he says.

There’s nothing broken about the underlying science being developed in biotech, or the prospects for innovation, he says. It’s just that stocks can stay cheap for longer than you expect. “Why would someone wake up tomorrow and say ‘I need to buy all the smidcap biotech stocks down 50%?’ It’s always tough to be the first one in the swamp.”

“I think it a little bit too early to be bullish,” agrees Cambiar’s Chan. “You need catalysts to change the narrative.”

Look for progress on these fronts.

1. More biotech mergers and acquisitions

“M&A would change the narrative, but it’s not happening,” says Chan.

There is a good case for it, though. “Big pharma has so much cash they could basically buy the whole smidcap universe,” notes Yee. Their cumulative cash balance has now risen to more than $300 billion.

“The CFOs of big pharma are looking at this carnage, and they are just licking their chops,” says McDonald. “You are probably going to see substantially more transactions down here.”

Yee expects M&A to pick up gradually, but he’s less optimistic than McDonald. “M&A is tough when markets are falling fast,” he says.

2. The FDA gets its act together

From baby formula shortages to drug-approval delays and terribly mixed signals on approval paths, the Food & Drug Administration has been a big source of problems and confusion for everyone from parents to biotech investors. “The FDA has become more unpredictable,” says Chan.

OK, it has had the distraction of the pandemic and the need to focus on vaccines and therapies. But now with COVID-19 winding down (hopefully), perhaps the FDA can refocus on drug approvals.

3. Broader market conditions improve

Investors continue to panic about inflation and recession, because they know the Fed can’t come to the rescue with the proverbial “Fed put” (stimulus to counter stock-market declines).

Since the Fed has taken the training wheels away from investors, they have to think through inflation and GDP growth on their own. So far, they’re doing a poor job since it seems clear inflation has peaked and we aren’t going into recession. Hopefully, they get up to the task soon.

Stocks to consider … or avoid

Chan singles out UCB UCBJY, -3.05% UCB, -1.85% , a Belgian biotech company. Its shares got hit hard in mid-May when the FDA dinged its request for approval of its bimekizumab therapy for the treatment of a chronic inflammatory disease called plaque psoriasis because of some manufacturing inspection issues.

Now it has to reapply, but the data supporting bimekizumab seem sound. It has already been approved in Europe, Japan, Canada and Australia.

She also likes the prospects for two other UCB therapies in late-stage testing for neurological disorders: zilucoplan and rozanolixizumab. Expect more data readouts and applications for approval in the second half of this year, possible catalysts.

Yee singles out Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, +0.58% , Fate Therapeutics FATE, +2.41% and Ventyx Biosciences VTYX, +3.51% .

Vertex has been posting strong revenue growth for its cystic fibrosis treatment trikafta (up 48% in the first quarter to $1.76 billion). It’s also showing good progress on pipeline therapies for cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, kidney disease, diabetes and pain. Its stock is down 14% from April highs of $292.75.

Fate Therapeutics stock has slumped 77% since August, even though there have been no negative developments, says Yee. Fate continues to show progress developing its natural killer cell immunotherapies for cancer. Fate doesn’t need to raise capital soon. It has a partnership with Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +1.26% to develop cancer therapies.

Ventyx Biosciences develops therapies for inflammatory diseases like psoriasis, arthritis, Crohn’s disease and colitis. It expects key Phase I trial data on two of them over the next four months.

The companies trading ‘for free’

Yee cautions against thinking companies trading below cash might get bought out simply because their science can technically be purchased for free. “They likely suffered from negative events,” he says. But he does have buy ratings on Olema Pharmaceuticals OLMA, -1.96% , which has around $7 per share in cash vs. a recent stock price of $2.10, and LianBio LIAN, -2.01% ($3.76 in cash vs. $2.47 stock price).

Olema is conducting early-stage studies of therapies for breast cancer. LianBio helps partners study and develop their therapies in China. It has a deal with Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY, -0.11% , for example, to develop a cardiovascular therapy there called mavacamten, approved in the U.S. Yee thinks this China angle alone is worth $13 a share for LianBio. It’s partnering with other companies to develop therapies for inflammation, respiratory and eye disorders.

“We appreciate sentiment may continue to be challenging on China stocks, but the company has plenty of cash to execute on the pipeline and ongoing trials including the lead mavacamten asset,” says Yee.

Note that these are tiny sub-$300 million market cap companies which can be quite risky in biotech.

Vaccine stocks

Moderna MRNA, -5.42% , Pfizer PFE, +3.00% and Novavax NVAX, -10.30% are way off the highs seen in the thick of the pandemic. But Yee cautions against getting too bullish on them. The reason: It seems like the pandemic is receding, and large vaccine buyers around the world have been opting out of purchase options and deferring shipments.

274,US House passes bill to fight oil and gas price gouging,2022-05-19 16:54:11,"
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. House passed a bill on Thursday that allows the U.S. president to issue an energy emergency declaration, making it unlawful for companies to excessively increase gasoline and home fuel prices.

The bill must pass the Senate, which is unlikely, and be signed by President Joe Biden to become law.

The legislation, sponsored by Democratic Representatives Katie Porter and Kim Schrier, passed the House 217 to 207, with no Republicans supporting it. In the Senate, evenly divided at 50 members in each party, 10 Republicans would need to support it for the bill to pass.

275,Carbon capture to receive 35 billion federal investment,2022-05-20 10:27:00,"The federal government is investing in machines that suck giant amounts of carbon dioxide out of the air in the hopes of reducing damage from climate change.

The Department of Energy said Thursday it will release $3.5 billion to groups developing direct air capture and other technologies that remove carbon dioxide, which when released into the atmosphere causes global warming.

Climate scientists say humans have already allowed too much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere to prevent dangerous rises in global temperatures. They say on top of curbing emissions we must also remove carbon dioxide from the air that’s already been released.

“This past month we saw the highest levels of CO2 emissions in the atmosphere in history, underscoring the fact that our efforts to tackle climate change will be inconsequential if we don’t act now to manage the greenhouse gas emissions that are currently putting public health and our environment at risk,” said Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm in a statement.

Companies such as Carbon Engineering and Climeworks are building direct air capture facilities that use giant fans to suck carbon dioxide out of the air and store it underground, or capture it to make synthetic fuel, soft drinks or concrete. But the facilities built so far remove just a tiny fraction of the carbon dioxide that scientists say is necessary to make a difference.

Developers are hoping the investment can help boost an industry that will need to scale up.

“If you want to reduce long-run climate risks, we will need to take CO2 out of the air,” said David Keith, professor of environmental science and engineering at Harvard and founder of Carbon Engineering, which designed a plant that captures carbon dioxide and turns it into synthetic fuel. “The best way to figure out what these methods cost and what their environmental impacts might be is to actually go build hardware that can stand up to public scrutiny.”

Carbon Engineering is working with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures and 1PointFive to develop a facility in the Permian Basin which would capture 1 million tons of CO2 annually.

The DOE money will support four large-scale regional direct air capture hubs that will include a network of carbon dioxide removal projects that each have the capacity to remove 1 million tons of carbon dioxide annually. Those projects will prioritize community engagement and environmental justice, the DOE said.

“I expect the impacts on health and land use in communities will be an important consideration,” said Roger Aines, energy program chief scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Lab, noting that facilities would use land in communities and would run on renewable energy, which would mean placing solar panels or wind turbines around them.

“The time is right for this,” Aines said. “And the only way to really know whether we’re going to like this kind of approach is to try it out.”

276,BlackRock JPMorgan others tell Texas they dont boycott energy companies,2022-05-19 16:29:33,"
May 19 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) and other top financial firms have told a Texas official they are not boycotting energy companies, responding to a request for information that could determine if they are able to continue to manage state funds.

The money managers are under pressure from a new Texas law that prohibits state agencies that invest funds from investing in financial firms found to boycott fossil fuel energy companies.

In a May 13 letter obtained by Reuters News under a public records request, BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, acknowledged to Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar that it has joined various efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions like the high-profile Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. read more


""Notwithstanding, our investment decisions are governed strictly by our fiduciary duty to clients, and that duty requires us to prioritize our clients’ financial interests above any commitments or pledges not required by law,"" according to the letter, signed by BlackRock's head of external affairs, Dalia Blass.

BlackRock had previously lobbied Texas officials, saying it supported the oil and gas industries, but had not cited its fiduciary duty. read more A BlackRock representative declined to comment further.

BlackRock estimated it runs $24 billion for Texas public pension plans, and cited $8.3 billion worth of backing for Texas projects like a natural gas utility and a carbon capture pipeline system.

A spokesman for Hegar did not immediately comment. His office has previously said a decision on which companies boycott the energy sector is likely by Sept. 1.

Financial firms face a growing debate over how investments might be used to address issues like climate change. read more

In another letter reviewed by Reuters, top Wall Street bank JPMorgan said it does not lend in some risky cases like mountaintop coal mining or arctic oil drilling, but said it engages billions of dollars with fossil fuel-based energy companies and green technology companies alike. Its decisions ""are based on ordinary business reasons,"" the bank said in a May 13 letter to Hegar.

A JPMorgan representative said the letter was in line with past comments the Wall Street bank has made.

Among more than 20 other company responses to Hegar's information requests reviewed by Reuters, most say they do not boycott energy companies as defined by Texas law.

""Hell no,"" responded John Alban, CEO of Cushing Asset Management of Dallas, to the boycott question.

But Maria Egan, director of shareholder engagement at Boston-based Reynders, McVeigh Capital Management, said in a letter to Hegar that the firm does not invest in fossil fuel companies and that about 30% of Texas electricity now comes from renewables.

""Your attempt to create an outlier with our firm for doing exactly what Texas is doing - investing in the future of energy - seems shortsighted and irresponsible,"" Egan wrote.

277,As Global Trade Gets a Reboot Heres How to Profit,2022-05-20 10:14:00,"Globalization reshaped the world economy over the past four decades, linking countries through the free flow of capital, people, and goods to bolster growth and—at least in theory—engender geopolitical harmony. Along the way, it built China into an economic powerhouse, pulled more than a billion people out of poverty, and created a burgeoning middle-class hungry for U.S. goods.

As the world grew closer, U.S. companies tapped low-cost labor abroad to create efficient global supply chains, reducing the need for warehouses filled with inventory and contributing to record profits and a free flow of cheap goods that helped keep a lid on inflation.

Much of that is now in question. U.S.-China tensions, the pandemic, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have exposed the risks of global integration. China’s ascent into a formidable economic and geopolitical rival has pushed the U.S. to increasingly view its relationship with the world’s most populous country through a national-security lens.

That has been compounded by pandemic-related disruptions. U.S. hospitals are rationing X-rays and CT scans because of shortages in chemicals, in turn caused by factory shutdowns thousands of miles away. Apple (ticker: AAPL) has warned that it could take as much as an $8 billion hit to sales in the current quarter as China’s zero-Covid policy interrupts supply chains and dents economic activity. India and Turkey are banning exports of grains and agricultural products as the war in Ukraine exacerbates food security concerns.

“For years, companies operated on the belief that periodic tensions with China or Russia wouldn’t disrupt critical supply chains covering goods, energy, metals, and minerals,” says Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “That assumption is no longer the case,”

Globalization 2.0 will take shape over years, but the early contours are already visible, with more companies and countries stressing safety and resiliency over cost and efficiency as they look to diversify and duplicate supply chains around the world.

A byproduct, at least in the short term, could be more trade as companies build up inventory as buffers. Even with the trade war, export restrictions that blacklisted some Chinese companies from U.S. technology, and supply-chain disruptions, global trade hit a record $28.5 trillion last year—13% higher than in prepandemic 2019.

In the long run, Globalization 2.0 is likely to be less lucrative for the private sector as governments direct a larger share of investments, often on national-security rather than economic grounds.

“The economic costs are going to be real,” says Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The result, he says, will be “lost opportunities,” lower returns on investment, and increased volatility.

That volatility could mean opportunity for investors in companies that are facilitating this shift by helping countries become more self-sufficient in critical areas such as semiconductors, or building production closer to home or in friendlier destinations.

Shares of many of these companies could get even cheaper in the coming months as the market digests recession concerns and the broader shifts at play. U.S. equities are baking in earnings growth for the next decade that suggests little change—even as the forces that boosted corporate profits are now challenged, says Rebecca Patterson, chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates, who sees reason for caution.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warns that the end of globalization as we know it is near—and could bring higher costs and margin pressures. Whirlpool CEO Marc Bitzer recently told analysts that the appliance giant was trying to reposition itself for a “new reality” of geopolitical tensions, freight cost inflation, and increased trade barriers as a result of the decoupling of global economies.

Big changes are ahead in areas linked to national security—including semiconductors and the rare earths critical to tomorrow’s technologies. Congress is expected to pass a China package this summer that includes money for more domestic semiconductor production and incentives to bring manufacturing of critical goods home—or at least move production to friendly countries.

China is moving to shore up its own technology and food security, as well as reduce its reliance on the dollar following the West’s sanctions on Russia. China is banning senior officials of the Communist Party and their families from holding real estate abroad or shares in companies registered abroad, The Wall Street Journal reported this past week.

Barring a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a decoupling that completely unwinds globalization is unlikely, considering the deep financial and economic ties between the U.S. and China. Exports to China represented about 858,000 U.S. jobs in 2020. More than 300 congressional districts have 1,000 or more jobs supported by those exports, according to the U.S.-China Business Council.

“The winners of this coming wave of globalization will be India and Southeast Asia. Everyone wants to invest there.” — Parag Khanna, founder of global strategic advisory firm FutureMap

The latest survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China indicated that about half of respondents delayed or decreased investments because of the latest Covid outbreak. Just 14% of businesses surveyed last year by the U.S.-China Business Council reported moving any part of their supply chain out of China. But strategists expect more new investment beyond China as companies look for regional alternatives and countries form regional blocs with like-minded nations.

Parag Khanna, founder of global strategic advisory firm FutureMap, says the U.S. is well positioned for this next wave because it is relatively self-reliant on multiple fronts. At the same time, he sees the center of gravity in trade moving east.

China accounts for 15% of global exports, nearly twice that of the U.S., and is the largest trading partner for just about every major country. China also sits at the center of the world’s largest trade bloc—the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership—which includes Japan and Indonesia, plus a dozen other countries.

Countries are hesitant to pick sides, even as the U.S. begins a campaign to bolster its Indo-Pacific alliance and form closer relationships with India and Southeast Asia.

“The winners of this coming wave of globalization will be India and Southeast Asia. Everyone wants to invest there: There’s a growing middle class and a more open society and democratic ways not found in China,” Khanna says. “They are in the sweet spot of geography, geopolitics, and demography.”

The transition to Globalization 2.0 promises to be gradual and messy, but investors can use the recent global market selloff to identify winners and recalibrate their assumptions about profits, economic growth, and returns.

Three funds and nine companies serve to illustrate the investments in the sweet spot for the upheavals to come.

India’s size, young workforce, and democratic system put it in an attractive spot as companies seek alternatives to China. India is stepping up efforts to become more competitive for manufacturers, cutting taxes and offering incentives to bolster its “Made in India” push, says Matthew Dreith, associate portfolio manager of the Wasatch Emerging Markets Select fund.

The iShares MSCI India exchange-traded fund (INDA) is a broad-based way into the action. Indian industrial companies are another, including air-compressor maker Elgi Equipments (522074.India), which is poised to take market share as companies seek alternative suppliers. It should also see increased demand as companies build duplicative supply chains around the world. Air compressors are widely used in manufacturing plants. Elgi’s valuation—50 times forward earnings—looks pricey, but Dreith says that long-depressed spending is picking up. That should boost margins, and the company’s heavy investments in Europe and U.S. should begin to pay off.

Low labor costs and an established manufacturing base should drive investment into Mexico from U.S. companies looking to bring its suppliers closer to home. While a slowdown in the U.S. could weigh on Mexico, in the longer term, the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF (EWW) offers a way to tap increased investment in the country.

Another beneficiary: Prologis Property Mexico (FIBRAPL14.Mexico), a $2.2 billion real estate investment trust that manages logistics and warehouses, and estimates that 30% of its manufacturing demand came from near-shoring last year. Increased near-shoring, along with growth in e-commerce and supply-chain disruptions, should help the company generate double-digit earnings growth for some time to come, says Matthews Emerging Markets Equity manager John Paul Lech.

Another promising area is emerging as governments look to become more self-reliant. China has laid out a road map of its priorities, with plans to generate 10% of its gross domestic product from the digital economy by 2025, making semiconductors and software critical to its goals. Sung Cho, senior manager for Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s Fundamental Equity, favors local companies like Kingdee International Software Group (268.Hong Kong) and semiconductor makers like Taiwan’s Silergy (6415.Taiwan).

The sharp selloff in Chinese stocks amid concerns about the economy and Beijing’s Covid shutdowns left these stocks trading at a 30% discount to global peers, despite similar growth rates, says Cho.

Semiconductors are the lifeblood of the global economy—a reason that China and the U.S. are intent on bolstering chip manufacturing at home. Demand for chips is also growing. Electric vehicles require double the number of chips that traditional cars do. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) sits atop the chip industry, with a more than 50% market share of global semiconductors and 95% share of 5-nanometer technology crucial to innovations in areas like artificial intelligence, 5G, and other technologies of tomorrow.

The company has been built for resilience, a byproduct of sitting in a geopolitical hot spot and managing relations with customers around the globe. It is building a $12 billion fabrication plant in Arizona and another plant in Japan, and is considering building plants in Singapore and India. At 15 times forward earnings, Taiwan Semi trades below its five-year average, as the sector is hit by concerns of a global slowdown and supply-chain disruptions.

“They are sensitive to U.S.-China tensions and changing world order and are planning around it—and are still in an extremely strong situation, which the market is unable to price properly,” says Jenny Davis, co-manager of Baillie Gifford’s International Alpha Strategy, which oversees $18.3 billion. The company’s dominance and three-year plan for $100 billion in capital spending is on a “monumental scale. No one else can compete.”

Cho favors semiconductor capital-equipment makers, which are selling at about a 25% discount to the S&P 500 index. KLA (KLAC) is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the buildout in leading-edge chip capacity. The company’s stock price has baked in recession fears but not its long-term potential.

The changing nature of global trade could also spark an industrial revolution as companies build new manufacturing hubs or turn to automation to defer the higher costs of shifting to pricier destinations. Industrials are vulnerable to fears of a global recession, but Elias Cohen, head of the international equity team at Neuberger Berman, sees the volatility as a good time to identify companies that are focused on electrical goods, robotics, and machinery, and are well positioned for the next decade.

The iShares Global Industrial ETF (EXI) is a broad-based way to tap the sector. Another beneficiary: Japan’s SMC (6273.Japan), which holds a roughly 45% global market share in pneumatic controls used in manufacturing and has strong pricing power. After selling automation-related stocks last year as valuations got too rich, Cohen has started to add some back in the recent selloff. SMC, for example, trades at 22 times forward earnings, below its five-year average.

Kennametal (KMT) is a U.S. beneficiary of Globalization 2.0 as efforts to build resilience in supply chains, especially around energy and critical minerals, increase demand for the company’s tools, dyes, and bits used in infrastructure projects and oil-and-gas exploration. It sells for 13 times forward earnings.

Charlie Bobrinskoy, who manages the focused value strategy at Ariel Investments, says the price bakes in a recession, even though he puts the recession odds at 50/50. He says the price doesn’t reflect the company’s longer-term prospects from a new phase of globalization.

Freight forwarder DSV (DSV.Denmark) does best when trade patterns change. The Danish company reported a first-quarter net profit that exceeded what it earned in all of 2019. DSV’s capital-light business model churns out cash flow, and management has a strong record of savvy capital allocation and consolidating the industry, says Baillie Gifford’s Davis. Analysts expect the company’s earnings to rise 25%, to $2.2 billion, or $9.70 a share, on top of a 81% increase last year. “The friction of change pushes customers to outsource their organization of freight transport,” says Davis.

The transition to a new type of globalization will come with its share of disruption. That boosts the case for diversification, not just for companies with their supply chains, but also for investors with their portfolios. The latest market upheaval is a good time to start.

278,US power and natgas prices soar during spring heatwave,2022-05-19 16:25:21,"
May 19 (Reuters) - U.S. spot power and natural gas prices soared on Thursday to their highest a year or more in several parts of the country as consumers cranked up air conditioners to escape an early spring heatwave.

Even before the latest heat, gas futures were trading near a 13-year high as much higher prices in Europe and Asia kept demand for U.S. liquefied natural gas exports strong, especially since Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.

In Pennsylvania, next-day power at the PJM West hub and gas at the Dominion South hub rose to their highest since the February freeze in 2021.


AccuWeather forecast high temperatures in Philadelphia would jump from 79 Fahrenheit (26.1 Celsius) on Thursday to 87 on Friday and 95 on Saturday. The city's normal high is 75.

In Texas, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the grid for most of the state, forecast demand would peak at a monthly record on Thursday.

ERCOT said the grid had enough resources to meet demand.

At the start of the current heatwave, however, ERCOT was forced to urge conservation on May 13 after several power plants shut unexpectedly, causing real-time prices to soar over $4,000 per megawatt hour (MWh). read more

AccuWeather said high temperatures in Houston hit the 90s F every day since May 14 and will remain at those levels through Saturday. The city's normal high is 87.

ERCOT forecast demand would hit 72,424 megawatts (MW) on Thursday, topping the current May record of 70,804 MW on Tuesday. read more

In Louisiana, next-day gas at the Henry Hub benchmark jumped to its highest since hitting a record during the 2021 February freeze.

In Northern California, next-day gas at the PG&E Citygate rose to its highest since February 2019 for a second day in a row after a compressor failure on May 16 forced Gas Transmission Northwest to limit gas flows from Canada to the Pacific Northwest.

279,Finland says Russia suspending natural gas supplies,2022-05-20 10:14:00,"

Russia will cut off natural gas to Finland on Saturday after the Nordic country that applied for NATO membership this week refused President Vladimir Putin’s demand to pay in rubles, the Finnish state-owned energy company said Friday, the latest escalation over European energy amid the war in Ukraine.

Finland is the latest country to lose the energy supply, which is used to generate electricity and power industry, after rejecting Russia’s decree. Poland and Bulgaria were cut off late last month but had prepared for the loss of natural gas or are getting supplies from other countries.

Putin has declared that “unfriendly foreign buyers” open two accounts in state-owned Gazprombank, one to pay in euros and dollars as specified in contracts and another in rubles. Italian energy company Eni ENI, +0.75% said this week that it was “starting procedures” to open a euro and a ruble account.

The European Commission, the European Union’s executive arm, has said the system does not violate EU sanctions if countries make a payment in the currency listed in their contracts and then formally signal that the payment process is concluded. But it says opening a second account in rubles would breach sanctions.

That’s left countries scrambling to decide what to do next. Analysts say the EU stance is ambiguous enough to allow the Kremlin to keep trying to undermine unity among the 27 member countries — but losing major European customers like Italy and Germany would cost Russia heavily.

It comes as Europe tries to reduce its dependency on Russian oil and gas to avoid pouring hundreds of millions into Putin’s war chest each day but build enough reserves before winter from scarce worldwide supplies.

Finland refused the new payment system, with energy company Gasum saying its supply from Russia would be halted Saturday.

CEO Mika Wiljanen called the cutoff “highly regrettable.”

But “provided that there will be no disruptions in the gas transmission network, we will be able to supply all our customers with gas in the coming months,” Wiljanen said.

Natural gas accounted for just 6% of Finland’s total energy consumption in 2020, Finnish broadcaster YLE said. Almost all of that gas came from Russia. That pales in comparison to big importers like Italy and Germany, which get 40% and 35% of their gas from Russia, respectively.

According to Finland’s Gasum, Russian state-owned energy giant Gazprom said in April that future payments in its supply contract must be made in rubles instead of euros.

The cutoff was announced the same week that Finland, along with Sweden, applied to join the NATO military organization, marking one of the biggest geopolitical ramifications of the war that could rewrite Europe’s security map.

The government in Helsinki said Friday that it had signed a 10-year lease for a floating liquefied natural gas terminal in the Gulf of Finland and that necessary port structures will be built along the coasts of the Nordic country and Estonia, Economy Minister Mika Lintila said in a statement.

It “will play a major role in securing gas supplies for Finland’s industry,” Lintila said. The vessel should be ready to operate by next winter.

Finland and Estonia have been cooperating on renting the LNG terminal ship, which will provide enough storage and supply capacity to allow Russian gas to be abandoned in the neighboring countries, said Gasgrid Finland, the transmission network company. A gas pipeline between the neighbors will make it possible to import gas from the Baltic states instead of Russia.

Meanwhile, Italian company Eni said Tuesday that it was moving to follow Putin’s decree “in view of the imminent payment due in the coming days” but did not agree with the changes.

Italian Premier Mario Draghi has said he believes it is a violation of the contract, and has called on the European Commission to make a ruling so companies know if compliance violates sanctions.

280,As deadlines loom Russia says EU gas clients open payment accounts,2022-05-19 15:20:22,"
Summary

Summary Companies Russian gas payments due from May 20

European Commission advises against opening rouble account

Kremlin says half Gazprom clients open accounts

LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Half of Russian gas giant Gazprom's 54 clients have opened accounts at Gazprombank, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said on Thursday, as European companies approach imminent payment deadlines.

Companies in the European Union have been trying to confirm for weeks how they can legally buy Russian gas, after Moscow demanded foreign buyers start paying in roubles and cut gas supplies to Bulgaria and Poland last month after they refused to do so.

Russia has said foreign companies need to open two accounts to comply with its new payment mechanism - one for foreign currency, and one for roubles - and European companies need to complete any currency conversion within 48 hours.


The EU has shared two pieces of written guidance with countries, but neither explicitly said opening rouble accounts would breach EU sanctions against Moscow for its invasion of Ukraine. That has left some companies struggling to understand whether they can open these accounts to buy gas.

Nearly all the supply contracts EU companies have with Gazprom (GAZP.MM) are in euros or dollars and some top Western companies have already opened accounts at Gazprombank. read more

Novak told a forum on Thursday that around half of Gazprom clients have opened special accounts at Gazprombank in foreign currency and in roubles.

""Gas payments under main contracts are due ... and there is information that some big companies already opened accounts, paid (gas bills) and are ready to pay on time,"" Novak told a forum. ""In the next couple of days we will see a final list of who's paid in roubles and who's refused.""

Companies have payment deadlines for April gas deliveries from May 20.

'CLEAR AS MUD'

The European Commission has advised companies against opening a bank account in roubles at Gazprombank to pay for gas but has not explicitly said doing so would breach sanctions in its formal written guidance to governments on the issue, according to officials with knowledge of the matter. read more

European gas prices have been volatile all week due to concerns around how European companies can legally pay for Russian gas supplies.

""After mixed messages emerged from both sides earlier this week, the situation appears as clear as mud,"" said Wei Xiong, senior analyst at consultancy Rystad Energy.

Russia supplies around 40% of the EU's gas and nations have been under pressure to fill storage sites this summer ahead of winter and its higher seasonal demand.

EU gas inventories are currently around 41% full, compared to around 34% at the same time last year, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe data and appear to be on track to reach the EU's new minimal storage requirement of 80% of capacity by Nov. 1, said analysts at Jefferies.

Some gas buyers in Europe have taken different positions. Ultimately, EU countries are responsible for complying with the bloc's sanctions - which were approved unanimously by the 27 member states. Brussels could launch legal action against a government that failed to enforce them.

Germany's gas importers are allowed to open the rouble accounts, according to two people familiar with the matter on Thursday. Opening the accounts would not violate sanctions as long as gas payments would not be made in that currency, they added. read more

Uniper (UN01.DE), Germany's largest importer of Russian gas, has said it is transferring euros to an account at Gazprombank to comply with the payment mechanism.

Italian energy group Eni (ENI.MI) said this week it has started proceedings to open two accounts, one in euros and the other in roubles, to pay for Russian gas. read more

French power firm Engie (ENGIE.PA) said it would make the next payment to the Russian gas giant in euros before the end of the month as both companies have agreed on a solution in line with European sanctions.

Finland's state-owned energy provider Gasum refused to switch to the new scheme and said this week it would take its dispute over rouble payments with Russia's Gazprom Export to arbitration proceedings. read more

281,A Profit Recession Is Brewing Expert Says Hunker Down in Cash,2022-05-20 09:46:00,"If there is one person who wasn’t shocked by the massive misses in big retailers’ results this past week, it’s our longtime (but no way old) pal, Stephanie Pomboy, who heads the MacroMavens institutional economic advisory. Even though she has been coping with a (thankfully) mild case of Covid-19, she’s still as sharp, and acerbic, as ever in sizing up the current situation.

Not to lose the short-attention-span types, here are some of Steph’s searing insights:

We’re now experiencing withdrawal pangs after the massive injection of fiscal and monetary stimulus of the past two years, which actually boosted asset values more than real economic activity. With manna no longer falling from Washington, consumers are resorting to credit cards to pay the soaring costs of incidental items, such as food, energy, and rent. Companies also are getting squeezed. Producer prices are racing farther ahead of consumer prices by the biggest margin on record,

There’s also some good news. Amid the shortages of everything out there, the supply of one thing—labor—might improve. Some folks enriched by the soaring prices of assets, whether stocks, houses, or cryptocurrencies, joined the leisure class for a while. As asset prices start to deflate, some of these nouveau riche face the chastening prospect of actually having to return to work.

Pomboy says that both Wall Street and the Federal Reserve have woefully underestimated stimulus policies’ role in the current recovery. After Uncle Sam injected approximately $10 trillion in fiscal and monetary largess into the U.S. economy, nominal gross domestic product increased by about $2.3 trillion, a pathetic bang for the buck. Household net worth ballooned by $34 trillion, however, which compares with the $24 trillion U.S. economy. In effect, U.S. consumers were handed roughly two full years of income, via the increased value of their houses and of their 401(k) accounts and other securities holdings.

Now the movie is on rewind. The notion of consumers sitting on an ample cushion of savings is wrong, Pomboy says, with personal savings back to the December 2019 level. Credit-card balances, which were slashed after America received its government stimulus fix, are ramping up at a record 16% annual clip. It’s hard to imagine consumers taking on double-digit interest charges on plastic if they weren’t strapped to pay the escalating tabs at the checkout counter, gas pump, and rental office, she adds.

The stresses that dominate the everyday lives of most Americans shocked Wall Street via the first-quarter earnings reports from retailers this past week, highlighted by the 28.7% two-day swoon by Target (ticker: TGT) on Wednesday and Thursday. The soaring food, energy, and housing expenses are crowding out discretionary spending, Pomboy says. Retailers who cater to the hoi polloi can’t pass on their rising costs, resulting in massive margin squeezes that are decimating their stocks.

Yet to be seen is the effect of the now-deflating asset bubble. She passed along a chart of the JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) overlaid with the Wilshire 5000 index, which measures the broad U.S. stock market in dollars. Through the most recent reading in March, the tightening in the labor market indicated by JOLTS moved in virtual lockstep with the Wilshire.

Sometime soon, however, the reverse could happen. According to Wilshire Associates, the U.S. stock market has shed some $10.1 trillion in value, or 19.9%, this year through Thursday. The losses are relatively recent, with $7.1 trillion of that drop coming since the current quarter began, including $2.6 trillion in May, $1.7 trillion of which was torched just in Wednesday’s rout.

That doesn’t take into account the approximately trillion dollars in cryptocurrency wealth that’s evaporated globally this year, according to Goldman Sachs’ economic team, led by Jan Hatzius. Declines in household wealth point to a significant drag on spending, not so much from crypto as from conventional assets. Equities accounted for about 33% of household wealth at the end of 2021, compared with just 0.3% for crypto, they write in a client note.

Labor-force participation among younger males—crypto’s main fan base—has nearly fully recovered, the Goldman economists say. Prior academic studies have found that the wealth effect mainly affects labor-force participation among those near retirement age, who might be more apt to take their money and run.

On the surface, the jobs numbers appear to show labor demand continuing to stay ahead of supply. But peering beneath the surface, Pomboy sees confusing data. While April’s establishment survey found a solid 428,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, the separate survey of households showed a 353,000 decline in employment. While the household series (from which the headline jobless rate is derived) tends to be more volatile month to month, she has never seen such a wide split, suggesting there’s something amiss in the figures.

And recently, some big tech companies, including Meta Platforms (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Uber Technologies (UBER), have announced more restrained hiring policies. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have been creeping up, to 218,000 in the week ended May 14. That’s an historically modest level, but it’s still up from the 53-year low of 166,000, touched in March. As profit margins are squeezed, labor costs are certain to go under the microscope.

At the same time, Pomboy adds, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell wants to come across as “Volcker 2.0,” a reference to the Fed chief who vanquished inflation four decades ago with 20% interest rates and back-to-back recessions. And equity analysts have yet to seriously pare their earnings forecasts, with those for consumer-discretionary companies still pointing to 30% gains for 2022, she observes.

Pomboy’s conclusion: We’re in the early innings of an unfolding profit recession. The Fed would likely welcome wage gains if the jobs market weakens. Meanwhile, she advises investors to resist any temptation to buy the dips. Instead, she advises, hunker down in cash; the lows are still a distance away.

282,CoucheTard Targets 200 EV Charging Sites at North America Stores by 2024,2022-05-20 08:18:00,"By Robb M. Stewart

Alimentation Couche-Tard Inc. said it plans to have electric-vehicle chargers at 200 Circle K and Couche-Tard stores across North America by 2024 as it begins rolling out fast chargers in South Carolina.

Couche-Tard said Friday it activated its first U.S. site with high-power DC fast charging under the Circle K banner at a store in Rock Hill, which it plans to use to better understand customer needs, track driver usage and the impact on in-store foot traffic. The South Carolina store was selected to EV charging stations in the U.S. because of its location along a commuter and travel corridor in a major metropolitan area where EV traffic is expected to grow, the company said.

The gas station and convenience-store operator said that with a broad footprint of more than 9,000 stores across the continent, it is well-positioned to deliver energy to customers on the go, building on its experience with EV chargers at sites in Scandinavia.

Couche-Tard began introducing EV charging stations four years ago in Norway and now has a network of more than 1,000 chargers covering more than 230 Circle K stores in Norway, Sweden and Denmark, and it said it recently started deployment in other European locations.

283,Most Shoppers Have Never Seen This Inflation The Results Havent Been Pretty,2022-05-20 06:54:00,"Retail earnings this week have put the spotlight on inflation. When you look at how companies have talked about it, there are several ways it is affecting them.

The first is that it changes patterns of consumer spending. The highest rate of consumer price gains in four decades means that households can’t buy as much with their money, even if they are nominally spending more of it.

This forces some tough choices. It seems, based on earnings from Home Depot, Target, and Walmart, that shoppers are choosing to buy food and home-improvement goods. That may also imply they expect to keep working from home a while longer, so companies that help people do that comfortably are in better shape than others. Home-technology provider Best Buy reports on Tuesday.

More discretionary goods such as clothes aren’t seen as a priority. Kohl’s and Ross earnings disappointed. Bath & Body Works also fell short. Macy’s and Nordstrom are up next week.

A second effect is on company margins. Companies themselves are having to pay more for transportation and supplies. Company results suggest they are having a hard time passing on the full cost to consumers, weakening their profits.

Then there is what spending now tells us about expectations. In theory, faster inflation encourages people to buy things today on the expectation that they will be more expensive in the future. In practice, people may just reassess the things they don’t need and stop buying them altogether, even if they’re from discount stores such as Dollar General or Dollar Tree.

Most shoppers have never coped with inflation this fast, and the effects may be different from what was observed in the 1970s or 1980s. While the Federal Reserve is resolute in bringing it under control, it won’t slow down quickly, so there are bound to be more surprises ahead.

Boeing’s Starliner Reaches Orbit, Lifting the Stock

Boeing investors have needed good news and this week they got some. Boeing’s Starliner spaceship is orbiting Earth on its way to the International Space Station, after taking off Thursday night from Cape Canaveral, Fla., atop a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket.

This is an uncrewed test flight for the spacecraft. After Starliner passes all its tests, it will carry crews and cargo to and from the ISS, just like SpaceX and its Dragon spaceship. The ship should dock with the station in about a day.

More Investors Reject Executive Pay at S&P 500 Companies

Shareholders at more than two dozen major U.S. companies have rejected executive pay increases by large percentages in nonbinding shareholder votes, including at JPMorgan Chase and Intel Corp., in a sign of growing investor dissatisfaction, The Wall Street Journal reported.

In 2021, CEO pay at S&P 500 companies including stock awards averaged $14.7 million , a sixth straight record. Nine CEOs received more than $50 million. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon’s $84.4 million pay included a $50 million retention bonus that only 31% of shareholders supported.

Covid Boosters for 5-11yos Coming After CDC OKs

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expanded eligibility for Covid-19 boosters after its vaccine experts recommended that children ages 5 to 11 receive the third dose of Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine. About 28 million children in that age group are eligible starting five months after their initial two vaccine doses.

The pediatricians, infectious-disease experts, and other medical experts voted 11-to-1 to recommend the booster for that age group. The CDC also strengthened its advice that those 12 and older who are immunocompromised and people over 50 get a second booster given rising hospitalizations.

Existing-Home Sales Down, but Prices Hit Another High

Sales of existing homes dropped 2.4% to a seasonally adjusted rate of 5.61 million in April, their lowest rate since June 2020, the National Association of Realtors said on Thursday. Sales were 5.9% lower than last year, and Chief Economist Lawrence Yun said more declines appear imminent.

The average existing home sold for a record $391,200 in April, up 14.8% from last year. Rising mortgage rates combined with higher prices are making homes less affordable, especially for first-timers, who were 28% of buyers in April, down from 30% in March and 31% a year ago.

Retailers Falter on Inflation Threat, While Apparel Makers Thrive

This earnings season, the stores that sell the merchandise are losing out to the companies that make it, as demonstrated in the diverging performances of Ross Stores and Kohl’s compared with apparel makers Deckers Outdoors and VF Corp., the maker of Timberland footwear and North Face jackets.

At Kohl’s, same-store sales fell 5.2% and the company slashed its expectations for earnings per share this year to a range of $6.45 to $6.85 from as much as $7.50. Sales weakened in April as shoppers faced higher prices for goods without the stimulus checks they had last year.

Ross said same-store sales sank 7% and it said it expected that measure to drop 4% to 6% for the current quarter and fall up to 4% for the full year, citing inflation affecting consumer shopping choices . Margins were hit by freight and wage costs, it said.

What’s Next: Investors are bracing for more bad news when Dollar General and Dollar Tree report next week. Dollar Tree, in particular, skews more toward discretionary purchases. With lower-income consumers feeling the inflationary pinch, that could hurt the retailers that cater to them.

284,I cant see the light War fuels surging prices in Europe,2022-05-20 05:57:00,"Edoardo Ronzoni inspects a construction site near Milan that he shut down in March as costs for materials skyrocketed. He can’t complete a half-built roundabout at an intersection known for fender-benders because asphalt, cast-iron pipes and concrete are too expensive — prices exacerbated by Russia’s war in Ukraine.

Public works projects in Italy are grinding to a halt just as the European Union is injecting 108 billion euros ($114 billion) in pandemic recovery money meant to launch a construction frenzy.

Ronzoni laments that his company has already lost its three busiest months and expects the worst is ahead: “We fear we won’t be able to work this year. We are closing all of our sites.”

The war has accelerated inflation across Europe and the world, with prices for energy, materials and food surging at rates not seen for decades. It’s causing sticker shock at the grocery store, gas pumps, electricity bills and construction sites.

Soaring oil and gas prices are the key driver of inflation in Europe, which is heavily reliant on Russian energy to generate electricity and power industry. Inflation is expected to hit nearly 7% this year in the 27-nation EU and is contributing to slowing growth forecasts.

Fishmongers and farmers are being forced to charge prices for their catch and crops that even they see as astronomical. High fuel prices threaten to paralyze ground transport of goods. Bread prices are soaring from Poland to Belgium. Protests over price hikes have erupted in places like Bulgaria. While governments have responded with tax cuts and other aid, they face limits in easing the impact of volatile energy markets.

Even the thrifty, with backyard hens, are wondering if the price of feed is worth the eggs they yield. Alina Czernik, a shop assistant in Warsaw, does the math, as she sees prices of grain for her hen go up 150%, to 200 zlotys ($45) per 100 kilograms (220 pounds).

It is spreading a sense of futility, especially for those with low incomes.

“I’ve been a positive person, but for now, I can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel,” said Eva Fuchsova, a mother of three who lives in the town of Touskov in western Czech Republic.

“I have to tighten my belt. I buy fruits and vegetables so my kids have everything, but I don’t touch it,” she said.

Economists are calling it a perfect storm, striking as countries unleashed spending to spur an economic rebound from the COVID-19 pandemic. Surging customer demand overwhelmed factories, ports and freight yards, with resulting shortages driving up prices.

Add to that: The war in Ukraine has blocked exports of raw materials like steel and minerals that kept western Europe humming, as well as commodities like grains and seed oil, accentuating global shortages.

Inflation is running especially hot in central and Eastern European countries nearest the battlefields of Ukraine. Prices in April rose 14.2% in the Czech Republic, 12.3% in Poland and 10.8% in Greece. They’re an eye-popping 61% in Turkey, which saw its currency lose 44% of its value against the dollar last year.

Shop workers from Warsaw to Istanbul say customers are cutting back, buying lower-priced items, giving up on niceties like fresh-cut flowers and items they can delay, like new clothes.

In the Turkish capital, butcher Bayram Koza said he has seen a 20% drop in sales after prices nearly doubled, largely due to the cost of feed. That is making livestock breeding unprofitable, and many farmers are selling and moving to the city, he said.

“Even in (the affluent district of) Cankyaya, people are no longer buying according to their needs, but according to what they can afford. Those who bought two kilos of ground beef are now buying a kilo at the most,” he said.

On the Greek island of Rhodes, fish restaurant owner Paris Parasos gets up at dawn to go out on fishing trips to keep costs down. But he has still had to raise prices at his restaurant in the island’s main town as cooking oil prices quadrupled. Plus, cooking gas and electricity bills are three times higher.

“I could lower the quality and use the oil more, but I refuse to do it. We want customers to return and expect the same quality,” Parasos said.

In Poland, bread prices are up 30%, sending shoppers to discount outlets. Bakers in Belgium are laying off workers, as prices for a loaf rise by 30 cents, to 2.70 euros ($2.85).

“I know bakers who work 13 or 14 hours a day to get out of this and honor their loans,” Albert Denoncin, president of the French-speaking bakery federation, told La Premiere radio. “We can do it for a while, but when I hear from the World Bank management that this will last until 2024, we are not going to make it.”

In Spain, truckers have gotten some relief on diesel prices thanks to government emergency measures, including a small rebate and permission to pass along higher fuel costs to customers.

Still, the burden is high. Óscar Baños, who drives his own cargo trailer out of the central Spanish town of Palencia, said tires have risen from 400 to 500 euros, a new truck cab is up from 100,000 to 120,000 euros, and a liter of diesel has risen from 1.20 to 1.90 euros in the past year. That’s the equivalent of a gallon of gasoline rising from $4.80 to $7.60.

“There is a lot of uncertainty, not just in our sector but across the board,” Baños said.

Europe’s auto market also is facing price hikes as factory shutdowns in Ukraine, sanctions on Russia and an existing global semiconductor shortage crimp supplies of components needed to make cars.

As a result, average new car prices in Europe are expected to rise $500 to $2,000 this year, according to Nishant Mishra, associate director of investment research at Acuity Knowledge Partners.

Back in Milan, the roundabout is just one of half a dozen sites Ronzoni has had to close in recent months. He finds himself unable to deliver the work at the contracted prices.

High costs mean companies are not bidding to take on public works, including a bridge in Rome that was to be the first project built with EU recovery funds. The money earmarked for infrastructure, worth nearly half of the 220 billion euros from the EU, is at risk — along with the jobs it would bring, according to ANCE National Association of Construction Workers.

The government has announced 3 billion euros to help cover increased prices, but builders it’s not sufficient, with costs up an average of 40%, but sometimes much higher. Iron prices, for example, are up 170%, Ronzoni said.

“It’s exponential,” he said.

285,Australia set for polls with economy China climate dominating debate,2022-05-20 05:39:00,"Australians will go to the polls on Saturday following a six-week campaign that has focused on pandemic-fueled inflation, climate change and fears of a Chinese military outpost being established less than 2,000 kilometers (1,200 miles) off Australia’s shore.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s conservative coalition is seeking a rare fourth three-year term.

He began the campaign in April by urging voters to stick with a government that delivered one of the lowest pandemic death tolls of any advanced economy rather than risk the opposition center-left Labor Party.

An early election late last year had been widely anticipated with Morrison expected to reap the political capital from his government’s success in containing the spread of COVID-19 in the first year of the pandemic.

But his nickname “ScoMo” was changed by critics to “SloMo” a year ago when Australia’s vaccine rollout fell months behind schedule.

Australia has recorded more than double the number of COVID-19 deaths so far this year than it did during the first two years of the pandemic. Around 8,000 people have died with COVID-19 among Australia’s population of 26 million. Only 2,239 died in 2020 and 2021. The more transmissible virus variants have tarnished the government’s pandemic record.

Opposition leader Anthony Albanese noted on Friday that he was the first candidate with a “non-Anglo Celtic name” to run for prime minister in the 121 years since the office was created.

Albanese was brought up in Sydney by a single Irish-Australian mother who fell pregnant in 1962 to an Italian during a trip to Europe. She took the father’s name and lied that they had been married before he died in a car accident. Father and son first met in 2009.

Albanese has recounted his own childhood hardships in advocating Labor policies of cheaper child care for low- and middle-income families and better nursing home care for the elderly.

“Part of what I’ve said during this campaign is: no one held back and no one left behind,” Albanese said. “No one left behind because Labor will always look after the vulnerable and the disadvantaged.”

The government changed voting regulations on Friday to enable thousands of people who have recently been infected with COVID-19 to vote by phone.

Some polling booths would be closed on Saturday because many of the 105,000 election workers were sick with the virus or flu. Army reservists have been asked to fill in, an official said.

The pandemic and the war in Ukraine have pushed up costs of living and cast doubt on the conservatives’ boast of being better economic managers than Labor.

After the annual inflation rate soared to 5.1% in the March quarter, the central bank lifted its benchmark interest rate for the first time in more than 11 years from 0.1% to 0.35%.

Opposition treasury spokesperson Jim Chalmers described the rate hike this month as a “full-blown cost of living crisis on Scott Morrison’s watch.”

Labor has also taken aim at the government’s foreign policy credentials after China and the Solomon Islands confirmed during the election campaign they had finalized a bilateral security pact. Labor described it as Australia’s worst foreign policy failure in the Pacific since World War II.

Australia already has a security pact with the Solomons and is the impoverished South Pacific island nation’s most generous provider of foreign aid.

Foreign Minister Marise Payne had proposed in November doubling Australian aid to the Pacific to 2.88 billion Australian dollars ($2 billion) a year to counter China’s rising influence, The Australian newspaper reported on Friday, citing unnamed sources. But she was refused by her Cabinet’s national security committee colleagues.

Morrison declined to confirm or deny the newspaper report because of the secrecy surrounding the committee’s deliberations.

Morrison rejected the premise of a question when a reporter asked if he would consider doubling Pacific aid to counter Beijing’s moves.

“You’re suggesting that if you just double funding in the Pacific then somehow the Chinese government doesn’t have any influence or won’t be successful in seeking to coerce or exert its influence in the southwest Pacific,” he said. “That’s your assumption and that assumption doesn’t hold.”

Solomons Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said that there will be no Chinese naval base in his country and China has denied seeking a military foothold in the islands.

Senior government lawmakers have said the timing of the China-Solomons agreement during an election campaign is evidence that Beijing was attempting to undermine the ruling coalition’s prospects for reelection.

The government maintains that Beijing wants a change of leadership because a Labor administration would be less likely to stand up against Chinese economic coercion.

As well as campaigning against Labor, Morrison’s conservative Liberal Party is fighting off a new challenge from so-called “teal” independent candidates to key government lawmakers’ reelection in party strongholds.

The teal independents are marketed as a greener shade than the Liberal Party’s traditional blue color and want stronger government action on reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions than either the government or Labor are proposing.

The government aims to reduce Australia’s emissions by 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2030. Labor has promised a 43% reduction.

Recent opinion polls have put Labor narrowly ahead of the coalition. But the pollsters’ credibility has yet to recover since their spectacular failure in the 2019 election.

The split of votes between the government and Labor in 2019 was 51.5% to 48.5% — the mirror opposite of the result that Australia’s five most prominent polls predicted.

288,Sri Lanka forced to close schools ask workers to stay home amid crippling fuel shortage looming bankrupcy,2022-05-20 02:57:00,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) — Sri Lankan authorities on Friday closed schools and asked public officials not to come to work in a desperate move to prepare for an acute fuel shortage that is expected to last days amid the nation’s worst economic crisis in decades.

The Public Administration Ministry asked the public officials — except for those who maintain essential services — not to come to work on Friday “in a view of current fuel shortage and issues in transport facilities” across the country.

State- and government-approved private schools also closed Friday amid the worsening fuel shortage, with thousands of people waiting in queues at fuel stations across the country for days at a time.

Sri Lanka is now almost without gasoline and faces an acute shortage of other fuels as well.

The government has been struggling to find money to pay for the importation of fuel, gas and other essentials in recent months as the Indian Ocean island nation is on the brink of bankruptcy.

Its economic woes have brought on a political crisis, with the government facing widespread protests.

President Gotabaya Rajapaksa swore in nine cabinet ministers Friday, raising the total number to thirteen as he attempts to stabilize the government after a string of resignations.

The new ministers include four independent lawmakers, three from the ruling and two from the main opposition. Four ruling party lawmakers were appointed as cabinet ministers last week.

Rajapaksa sought a unity government in early April but the largest opposition political party, the United People’s Force, had rejected the proposal.

For months, Sri Lankans have endured long lines to buy those essentials, most of which come from abroad. Shortages of hard currency have also hindered imports of raw materials for manufacturing and worsened inflation.

Protesters blocked main roads to demand gas and fuel, and television stations showed people in some areas fighting over limited stocks.

Authorities have announced countrywide power cuts of up to four hours a day because they can’t supply enough fuel to power generating stations.

Sri Lanka has suspended repayment of about $7 billion in foreign loans due this year out of $25 billion to be repaid by 2026. The country’s total foreign debt is $51 billion. The finance ministry says the country currently has only $25 million in usable foreign reserves.

Protesters have occupied the entrance to the president’s office for more than a month, calling for Rajapaksa to resign.

Months of anti-government rallies have led to the near-dismantling of the once-powerful ruling family, with one of the president’s brothers resigning as prime minister, and other siblings and a nephew leaving their Cabinet posts. Protesters accuse the Rajapaksas of triggering the crisis through corruption and misrule.

Sri Lanka’s new Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said Monday that about $75 billion is needed urgently to help provide essential items, but the country’s treasury is struggling to find even $1 billion.

Attacks by Rajapaksa’s supporters on protesters last week sparked nationwide violence that left nine people — including a lawmaker — dead, and more than 200 injured. Homes of lawmakers and their supporters were burned down.

289,Recreational Vehicle Demand Hasnt Picked Up Keep an Eye on Production,2022-05-19 16:11:00,"Thor Industries and Winnebago Industries stocks took a beating on Thursday after D.A. Davidson analyst Brandon Rolle said recreational vehicle demand is worse than expected and companies have an excess of units on hand. Thor disagreed but only partly.

Rolle, in his latest round of checks, took pictures of extra units stored on farmland in Elkhart, Indiana, while he found factory lots and storage yards to be completely filled. He blamed cancellations by large dealer chains and RV sellers overestimating demand for the main retail selling season—April and May—for the large inventory on hand.

The analyst cut his rating on Thor (ticker: THO) to Underperform from Neutral while he lowered Winnebago’s (WGO) rating to Neutral from Buy.

Thor’s COO Todd Woelfer refuted the claim, saying it has been careful about its production and all the units spotted are presold and waiting to be delivered. Winnebago didn’t respond to questions from Barron’s.

“Fuel prices created challenges to get drivers …which has created a short term bottleneck in delivery,” Woelfer said. The other issue has been the difficulty of getting units across the border to Canada because of pandemic restrictions, he said. “We are working through [getting the units delivered].”

What they both agree on is the declining consumer demand for RVs and order cancellations.

“At the end of our last quarter we had a backlog, and we asked the dealers if they wanted to cancel,” Woelfer said, pointing to the $17.73 billion of backlog or orders built to be sold that the company reported in March, which he knew to be a lot. “There were cancellations for sure but not a massive number.”

Woelfer confirmed that Thor doesn’t have any open orders or RVs manufactured in anticipation of sale and that it has adjusted production since mid-March as the market is beginning to soften a bit after a surge of sales during the pandemic. “The selling season was softer than what was presumed,” he said.

Rolle’s checks indicate April RV retail sales were weaker than March, and May isn’t seeing the usual demand pickup. The analyst now believes a return to the type of promotional activity from dealers seen before the pandemic could appear more quickly than many expected.

Stock of Thor and Winnebago fell as much as 7% on Thursday and are at $72.75 and $46.72, respectively. Both stocks have fallen over 30% so far this year, while the S&P500 index is down 18% this year. Rolle has a $60 price target on Thor and $52 target for Winnebago’s stock.

Dealers indicated to Rolle there were several reasons affecting retail demand, starting with inflated prices, which are up over 60% to 70% compared with before the pandemic. There is also the return of prepandemic vacation and entertainment options. And gasoline prices are high. Nationally gas prices were up over 50% to $4.59 on Thursday versus a year ago, and the price of diesel is up more than 75%,% to $5.58 a gallon, according to AAA.

Rolle found that there is increased used inventory entering the market. On average, calls coming from customers looking to sell outweighed customers looking to buy at a 3:1 ratio in recent months, he noted. The checks confirm Statistical Surveys data, which he said shows a 40% increase in used units listed in May compared with last year.

Investors should keep an eye on the coming earnings, when the drop-off in demand may start showing up. Thor reports fiscal third quarter earnings on June 6, and Winnebago reports on June 22.

290,Barr Bidens pick for Fed regulation role cruises through confirmation hearing,2022-05-19 17:22:33,"
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - Michael Barr, the second person nominated by Democratic President Joe Biden to be the Federal Reserve's Wall Street cop, looked to be on a path to confirmation after testifying before the Senate on Thursday.

Barr, who served as a senior Treasury Department official under Democratic President Barack Obama, received some skeptical questions from Republican lawmakers. But there was little indication of any concerted effort to sink his candidacy, and moderate Democrats appeared supportive of him.

Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee, Barr struck a measured tone on a wide range of issues, including financial risk from climate change and the proper regulation of cryptocurrencies, while vowing to take a holistic view on the overall state of bank regulation in the United States.


He emerged from the hearing in a stronger position than Sarah Bloom Raskin, Biden's first nominee for Fed supervision vice chair, who withdrew her nomination after Democratic Senator Joe Manchin refused to back her.

Manchin opposed Raskin in large part due to her past comments suggesting financial regulators should play an aggressive role in helping transition the economy to using cleaner forms of energy. When pressed on the climate issue on Thursday, Barr insisted the Fed had ""important but quite limited"" powers, which are focused on assessing the risks banks might face from climate change, as it would any other looming concern.

""I think the Federal Reserve ... should not be in the business of telling financial institutions to lend to a particular sector or not to lend to a particular sector,"" he said.

Barr, currently a law professor at the University of Michigan, has already drawn support from moderate Democrats, as well as progressives anxious to ramp up scrutiny of Wall Street after what they say was regulatory easing under Republicans. At the Treasury, Barr was a central figure in the drafting of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law, which established a range of safeguards following the 2008 financial crisis.

Barr on Thursday faced some skepticism from Republicans, who repeatedly noted that he vocally opposed a 2018 bank deregulation measure that several moderate Democrats supported. Barr said he had concerns with some aspects of the law but supported one of its main principles: creating a tiered regulatory environment for banks, with the strictest rules reserved for the largest firms.

On cryptocurrency, Barr said the technology has ""some potential for upside"" but that stablecoins in particular could pose ""financial stability risks"" if customers believe they are more reliable than they are in reality. Barr previously advised and served on the boards of several crypto and fintech firms, but said at Thursday's hearing that, if confirmed, he would not work in the financial sector for four years after leaving government.

Barr would fill the remaining vacancy on the Fed board and take on a broad agenda that is likely to include revisiting rules that were eased under his predecessor, Randal Quarles, and taking steps to address climate change risk, fintechs and cryptocurrencies. read more

Progressives, who previously opposed Barr for other Biden administration posts as too moderate, have changed their tune as the Fed's top regulatory post has been vacant for months.

That wing of the party had seen several favored candidates including Raskin and Saule Omarova, a previous Biden pick for another bank regulator post, flop amid resistance from moderate Democrats.

If confirmed, Barr also will join the Fed as the central bank battles to bring down 40-year-high inflation. He reminded the panel that he is not an expert in macroeconomics but said inflation is far too high and that he would be ""strongly committed"" to bringing it down to the central bank's 2% goal.

“If the Federal Reserve is getting its job done right, the economy is working for everybody,” Barr said as he noted that the task to bring inflation down will be hard to achieve.

291,US crypto lobbyists in push to contain fallout from stablecoin meltdown,2022-05-19 10:04:03,"
WASHINGTON, May 19 (Reuters) - The cryptocurrency industry is scrambling to respond to U.S. lawmakers' concerns about stablecoins following the collapse of TerraUSD, which wiped billions off the cryptocurrency market. read more

The Blockchain Association and the Chamber of Digital Commerce, which represent some of the most influential crypto companies, say they have been fielding a flurry of questions from Capitol Hill since TerraUSD, known as ""UST,"" broke its peg last week and crashed 90%. read more

Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that try to maintain a constant exchange rate with fiat currencies. The $163 billion space is dominated by tokens that are pegged to the U.S. dollar, like Tether and USD Coin, by holding reserves in traditional dollar assets. Some stablecoins, like UST, however, use a complex algorithmic process to create the peg. read more


Capitol Hill lawmakers have been quizzing lobbyists on the structure of UST, seeking to determine whether its collapse was preventable and if other stablecoins could suffer the same fate.

Lobbyists are urging lawmakers not to crack down too hard on the gamut of stablecoins.

“The one thing we've been cautioning to the Hill is that we don't want to accidentally throw the baby out with the bathwater, because stablecoins we think are a really critical piece of the crypto ecosystem going forward,” said Kristin Smith, executive director of the Blockchain Association.

As the cryptocurrency market has exploded, reaching $3 trillion in November, the scrutiny of policymakers has increased.

In response, the crypto industry has beefed up its presence in Washington, spending $9 million on lobbying in 2021, according to Public Citizen. The Blockchain Association and Chamber of Digital Commerce spent $900,000 and $426,663, respectively, while crypto giants Coinbase Global Inc (COIN.O) and Ripple Labs forked out $1.5 million and $1.1 million respectively.

REGULATORY GRAY AREA

The industry's growing influence will be tested as it tries to contain the fallout from the UST and broader crypto market crash, which shrank from $1.98 trillion to $1.3 trillion in just six weeks due to investor fears over rising interest rates.

There are currently a handful of draft stablecoin bills floating around Congress. While analysts say the chances of Congress passing any of those this year is slim with lawmakers focused on the midterm elections, recent crypto market gyrations have caused many lawmakers to take notice.

“There are a lot of people in Congress that are interested in coming up with a regulatory framework to prevent something like this from happening again,” said Smith.

Cryptocurrencies fall into a regulatory gray area.

President Joe Biden's administration has largely focused on rules for dollar-backed stablecoins. A November Treasury Department-led report recommended Congress regulate stablecoin issuers like insured depository institutions, but it did not cover algorithmic stablecoins. read more

Lobbyists have had to quickly change tack and educate lawmakers on the differences, they say.

“All of the recent legislative proposals have been fiat-backed,"" said Cody Carbone, policy director at the Chamber of Digital Commerce. ""We thought we did pretty well in educating because we stayed within that scope, and now we're going to have to broaden that.”

While the group's members do not currently operate algorithmic stablecoins, the chamber is crafting talking points to explain how they work, said Carbone.

Regulators have warned that U.S.-dollar stablecoins could be susceptible to runs if users lose confidence, a fear that appeared to partially play out last week: after UST broke its peg, Tether, the largest stablecoin, briefly broke its peg too. read more

""This is essentially a call to action, because not all monies are created equal, and what one believes to be stable may actually not be stable,” said Jonathan Dharmapalan, CEO of eCurrency, a digital currency technology provider.

While the Blockchain Association's Smith agreed legislation was not imminent, the UST problem “certainly heightens that need,"" she said.

292,Cryptoloving SKoreans bet on Luna rising from ashes worrying regulator,2022-05-19 08:06:33,"
SEOUL, May 19 (Reuters) - Reckoning they have little to lose with prices so ridiculously low, South Korean speculators in recent days have piled into Luna, a cryptocurrency that lost 99.99% of its value last week after its paired stablecoin TerraUSD collapsed.

Both tokens are affiliated with Terra, a blockchain platform co-founded by Korean developer Do Kwon and, according to blockchain analytics firm Elliptic, investors in them have lost around $42 billion.

Luna had been one of the world's most popular cryptocurrencies and its downfall, alongside TerraUSD, caused mayhem across the crypto spectrum globally, with bitcoin losing around a quarter of its value between May 9-12. read more


Worth nearly $100 in late April, Luna is now trading at a fraction of one cent - so low that there has been a rush of buying from speculators betting that it will stage a miraculous recovery, with some clinging to the belief that it is just too big to be allowed to fail.

""Luna was once a major coin of top-ten market capitalisation, so they will do whatever it takes to revive it,"" one hopeful investor wrote in a blog on South Korea's internet platform Naver, without saying who ""they"" could be.

The blogger said he had bought 300,000 Luna over the weekend at 0.33 won ($0.0003) each, using an international crypto exchange.

As the sudden resurgence of buying crossed its radar, South Korea's Financial Services Commission warned people on Tuesday against investing in Luna.

The number of investors in the failed cryptocurrency rose more than 50% in just over two days at South Korea's major exchanges to stand at 280,000 as of May 15, according to a source at the FSC who, as is customary for South Korean bureaucrats, declined to be named.

The buying mostly came from domestic speculators, though there were some inflows from abroad, the source said.

The window for speculation is limited as Bithumb and Upbit, two of South Korea's largest exchanges, said they will suspend trading support for Luna on May 27 and May 20, respectively, while another, Coinone, has halted deposits in the crypto-currency ahead of a possible de-listing on May 25.

The buying has had little affect on the token's price. It has spent the past week flopping between one-hundredth and four-hundredths of a cent.

But the propensity of South Koreans, particularly the younger ones, to invest in volatile and risky assets from stocks to cryptocurrencies has worried regulators.

Their earlier enthusiasm had helped put Luna and TerraUSD among the world's ten largest cryptocurrencies ranked by market cap.

But things fell apart on May 10, when TerraUSD's 1:1 peg to the dollar was shattered. On Wednesday it traded at around 10 cents.

Unlike most other major stablecoins which are backed by other assets, TerraUSD's value is derived by complex algorithmic processes, linked to its paired token Luna, which is free floating.

Under the system, one TerraUSD token could be swapped for $1 of Luna, and vice versa, and once swapped the coins would be destroyed.

If TerraUSD fell below $1, traders were incentivised to buy the stablecoin to swap it for $1 worth of Luna, and so reduce the supply of TerraUSD's and push its price back to $1.

That was the theory, but the market proved the premise wrong.

As the market imploded, hundreds of outraged retail investors flooded social media with tales of woe, with some of them asking Kwon to compensate their losses.

Kwon, last week, announced plans to change the system so TerraUSD will backed by reserves in future, but it is unclear whether this plan is achievable. read more

There is little the government can do to protect investors as cryptocurrency trading takes place outside its regulatory sphere.

293,Analysis Crypto crash leaves El Salvador with no easy exit from worsening crisis,2022-05-19 05:34:03,"
Under populist President Nayib Bukele, a vocal cheerleader for the currency, El Salvador went all-in on bitcoin, not just becoming the world's first country to adopt it as a legal tender but also sketching out plans for a volcano-powered crypto mining hub and plans to issue the first sovereign bond linked to the coin.

With global borrowing costs on the rise and a big debt repayment on the horizon, El Salvador has other fiscal headaches than the impact of the currency's swoon. But the crypto slump has also closed some potential off-ramps from the crisis, including the now-postponed bitcoin bond.


""The government's financial problems are not because of bitcoin, but they have gotten worse because of bitcoin,"" said Ricardo Castaneda, senior economist and country coordinator for El Salvador and Honduras at think tank Central American Institute for Fiscal Studies (ICEFI). For the government, he said, ""bitcoin ceased to be a solution and has become part of the problem.""

Bitcoin has fallen 45% since El Salvador officially adopted it in early September, and 26% from its May high as crypto assets have been swept up in a risk-off investing environment.

The combined market value of all cryptocurrencies recently fell to $1.2 trillion, less than half of where it was last November, based on data from CoinMarketCap.

El Salvador's debt stood at $24.4 billion as of December, from $19.8 billion at end-2019, after the Bukele administration allocated millions of dollars to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic effects over the past couple of years.

The International Monetary Fund estimates that the current account deficit for its remittance and external financing-reliant economy will hover near $2 billion through 2025.

But adopting bitcoin set the country at loggerheads with multilateral lenders like the IMF, from which Finance Minister Alejandro Zelaya said last year the government was seeking $1.3 billion.

The fund has recommended that El Salvador ditch bitcoin altogether. Any deal for a credit line would have to address risks including ""those related to the adoption of bitcoin as legal tender as well as risks related to economic governance,"" an IMF official said on Wednesday.

Ratings agencies have warned bitcoin adoption could facilitate money laundering, and importantly, the bitcoin risk has given bond investors another reason to demand higher returns

As of Wednesday, they were seeking a record-high premium of 2,445 basis points over U.S. Treasuries (.JPMEGDELSR).

Bukele's moves to centralize power, from removing all the top judges on the country's supreme court to muscling through authorization to seek immediate re-election despite constitutional term limits, have helped drive the risk premium higher.

""If there isn't potential for bitcoin-growth dividends or innovative bitcoin-financing, then the Bukele administration will have to prioritize spending priorities and identify financing options,"" according to Siobhan Morden, head of Latin America Fixed Income Strategy at Amherst Pierpont.

Reuters calculations of a $36 million paper loss in bitcoin, enough to make at least some of those coupon payments, is based on Bukele's tweets and an estimate of prices on the purchase dates. The government has spent some $104.2 million on 2,301 coins now worth just $67.9 million using Wednesday's volume weighted average price.

The country has to service $329 million in interest due on its international bonds this year as well as $800 million in a bond set to mature in January.

ICEFI's Castaneda listed financing options including the Central American and Latin American development banks - CABEI and CAF, respectively - as possible patches for financing the $800 million payment due in January. Another option, he said, is to nationalize the country's pension fund to cover the fiscal deficit - which could be done by transferring the public's savings to a government account.

A debt restructuring for El Salvador is ""inevitable"" if the country continues with the ""current policy mix,"" said Polina Kurdyavko, head of emerging markets at BlueBay Asset Management. ""Debt in El Salvador could be sustainable with the right (IMF) program. But they have to act now.""

The country's finance minister, Zelaya, declined to comment for this story.

Salvadoran bonds trade between 43.5 cents and 34 cents on the dollar except for the January maturity at 75 cents, reflecting cautious optimism that the country could make that payment.

The cost to insure investors against a Salvadoran sovereign default over the next five years on Wednesday hit its highest level since 2020, according to S&P Global data.

294,Tether Reveals It Holds Foreign Debt as Scrutiny Increases,2022-05-20 15:36:00,"Tether has shifted into foreign debt to help back its cryptocurrency as the stablecoin issuer faces challenges to its dominance.

Less than two weeks after the collapse of another stablecoin—TerraUSD—fueled a cryptocurrency crash, Tether disclosed in its latest “assurance” report that $286 million of its $82.4 billion assets are held in foreign government bonds.

Tether’s previous report, to the end of December 2021, didn’t disclose holdings of non-U.S. Treasury bills.

Tether didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Barron’s for details on what foreign debt it holds or when it made the investments.

Signed off by independent auditor MHA Cayman of the Cayman Islands, the report dated March 31 details that the bulk of Tether’s assets—$39.2 billion—were held in U.S. Treasuries, with another $20.1 billion in commercial paper. A further $5 billion was held in “other investments” which includes “digital tokens.”

While TerraUSD, as a so-called algorithmic stablecoin, used financial engineering and an arbitrage incentive involving another crypto, Luna, to maintain its peg, Tether is meant to back each 1 USDT token it issues with $1. This ensures that its stablecoin can always be redeemed for a dollar and thus hold its peg.

But Tether’s holdings have recently come under increased scrutiny following the Terra meltdown. It was exacerbated by Tether’s own brief loss of its peg—down to 95 cents on the dollar—amid heavy selling pressure during last week’s cryptocurrency crash.

That scrutiny isn’t new to Tether. Based in the British Virgin Islands, the group has run into legal troubles, settling charges last year with New York state and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over its reserves and disclosure practices.

The company said last week that it had reduced its holdings of commercial paper by 50% over the past six months, and now holds the majority of its assets in Treasuries. A Tether spokesperson told Barron’s at the time that “unlike algorithmic stablecoins, Tether holds a strong, conservative, and liquid portfolio.”

Stablecoins are important because they act as the bedrock of trading and lending activities in the cryptocurrency economy, providing liquidity to individual traders, funds, and market makers. More than 90% of trading volume in crypto occurs in stablecoins, according to CoinMarketCap, and Tether is the third largest crypto after Bitcoin and Ether.

Without stablecoins doing their job—holding their dollar pegs through periods of extreme turmoil—the crypto market may face a loss of confidence, affecting trading activity and prices for tokens ranging from Bitcoin to Dogecoin.

Following Tether’s brief loss of its peg—which has happened before during similar short-term periods of volatility—the stablecoin has seen its issuances drop while those of a competitor, USD Coin, have risen.

Tether’s market capitalization has fallen from $83 billion from before its peg’s wobble to $74 billion on Friday. Meanwhile, USDC has seen its market cap rise from $43 billion to $53 billion.

295,MakerDAOs Rune Christensen says Terra was long overdue to collapse calls for rules on stablecoins,2022-05-20 15:10:00,"The collapse of the stablecoin TerraUSD was a bittersweet vindication for Rune Christensen, CEO cofounder of the decentralized crypto project MakerDao, as he had a long track record of arguing that Terra’s model was fundamentally flawed from the beginning.

TerraUSD is an algorithmic stablecoin whose value was pegged at $1. In order to defend that peg, users of TerraUSD were always able to exchange 1 TerraUSD USTUSD, -12.40% for $1 worth of an associated cryptocurrency, LUNA. But there was nothing that guaranteed LUNA’s LUNAUSD, -6.67 value beyond the collective confidence of its holders, a confidence that vanished in short order earlier this month.

Founder Do Kwon last week on Twitter said he was ”heartbroken” following Terra’s crash.

Kwon announced what he said is a plan to “rebirth a new Terra blockchain and LUNA” on Twitter Wednesday.

MakerDao, built on the ethereum ETHUSD, -3.32% blockchain, issues the Dai stablecoin that is backed by a diverse pool of crypto assets. It is known as “overcollateralized” because users have to post more than $1 worth of crypto assets to get back $1 worth of Dai DAIUSD, -0.03% .

MarketWatch caught up with Christensen over video conference Thursday to get his take on the crypto landscape in the wake of the Terra drama and a broader decline in the crypto market. The interview has been edited.

What’s your take on what happened to Terra?

The model that Luna and Terra used, which is nowadays called the algorithmic stablecoin, was invented all the way back in 2014. It was sort of a theoretical idea that everyone could just tell by looking at it that it wasn’t going to work.

During the bull market we just went through, these types of stablecoins started popping up. Terra somehow managed to have more legitimacy and more momentum and actually grow to this massive size.

But it was still obvious that these models didn’t work. It was completely clear. You can’t create money out of thin air. You can’t back something with itself and expect it to remain stable.

It was long overdue to collapse, and it was a tragedy that it was allowed to get so big, in part because it had a lot of major backers who created more legitimacy for it.

Why do you think sophisticated investors were drawn to this model?

Greed allows people to pretend that 1 plus 1 doesn’t equal 2. The promise of being able to print free money is just so strong.

They probably believed there was a chance it could work. There are also some really hardcore public figures that supported Luna and have gained credibility because they actually lost everything. So some of them truly believed that it worked and held on to the end and lost everything.

But there were others…[who] may also have been smart enough to understand that it was basically a ride you only want to take on the way up.

The appeal of Terra was in part because it was decentralized, and there’s a lot of debate as to whether Dai can credibly be called decentralized. What are your thoughts on this discussion?

The Luna community in particular liked to attack Dai, saying it’s not decentralized because it uses USDC USDCUSD, +0.01% , a centralized stablecoin, as part of its collateral.

The reason why Dai ended up doing that is because the original model that only used ethereum, it used these overcollateralized positions that ensure there’s always more ethereum than there’s Dai in circulation. The problem is you can’t control how much demand there is for people to bet on the price of ethereum.

The only way to scale Dai as demand kept growing was to add something you can easily scale, such as every time somebody wants to have more Dai you can just back it one-to-one with USDC.

From the perspective of single points of failure and decentralization, it’s not ideal to have huge amounts of exposure to just a single, centralized stablecoin. On the other hand it’s better than collapsing and going to zero. So in terms of the choices available, especially at the time when demand started to outstrip the ability to generate supply purely from ether, it was the right choice.

It’s always just a question of how to protect Dai users. Ultimately the holders of the MKR token MKRUSD, -1.23% that confers voting rights, their incentives are aligned with users of Dai because they have to backstop any losses that occur.

It’s obvious that you don’t want to have, whether its centralized or whatever, you don’t want to have all your collateral in a single token. So the community is working very hard to diversity out of USDC into coins like USDP, Paxos USD and Gemini USD.

Is this argument over centralization a productive one?

Centralization exists on a spectrum. You can look at different blockchains and some of them have hundreds of thousands of nodes and others maybe have 100 nodes and some have, like 20. They may all be decentralized, but they’re different levels of decentralization.

You shouldn’t really be thinking only about decentralization. You should be thinking about risk. Centralization isn’t the only type of risk you need be worried about, as evidenced by Terra, right?

It’s just one of many things that you need to consider if your goal is to create something that is stable, useful and relevant.

Where is DeFi going from here?

Now that blockchain has gone through these two major bubbles, one in 2017 and the huge bubble and crash we just had, I think we’re at the end of the honeymoon phase where people had this sense that something amazing is coming just around the corner that’s going to solve all the problems of finance.

The blockchain and DeFi still have the potential to make financial transactions much more efficient and cheap and major financial institutions and banks are working to get real financial instruments on the blockchain.

Societe Generale in France, for instance, is doing experiments where they have created these tokenized assets on MakerDAO, and we’re going to see what kind of benefits this provides.

See also: Prelude to the future of finance? SocGen is raising a loan from a DeFi protocol to refinance tokenized bonds

The collapse of Terra has brought into focus efforts in the U.S. to regulate crypto broadly and stablecoins in particular. What are your thoughts on this debate?

Before the Maker Foundation [which Christensen previously ran] was shut down because MakerDao became sufficiently decentralized to run on its own, we were eager to interact with regulators because we saw regulatory interaction and education as a cornerstone of making stablecoins work.

I’m a big supporter of regulation in general. Regulation exists for a reason and it can be a huge benefit for the space. If it’s done right it can be a huge benefit, it can create confidence and bring more people into the space.

Something like requiring disclosure of what’s backing a stablecoin, it obviously needs to be required by law. It makes no sense to create a product, call it stable and then say I’m not gonna tell you how it’s backed.

The space needs to grow up a little. It makes perfect sense for governments, if somebody is selling a black box and giving all sorts of promises about it, to bring protection to its citizens. It’s a financial transaction like any other and people shouldn’t be allowed to use the excuse that it’s blockchain, so we can just go out and cause harm to people.

296,Oklahoma abortion ban Starbucks Amazon to cover employee abortion travel costs,2022-05-20 15:06:00,"Starbucks SBUX, +0.88% is one of the latest companies to offer reimbursement to their employees for travel costs when they seek reproductive care in other states, including abortion.

The benefit will be available to any employee who cannot access these services within 100 miles of where they live, and also applies to the dependents of the family.

Several other major companies, including Tesla, Citigroup, Yelp, Lyft, Levi’s, and Amazon, have also announced that they would cover travel expenses for workers with limited access to safe abortion procedures in their home states. Such moves from companies come as abortion rights in the U.S. are under pressure.

Several states, including Texas and Oklahoma, passed restrictive abortion laws in recent years —Oklahoma lawmakers recently approved a bill that would prohibit all abortions with only some exceptions. Tesla moved its corporate headquarters from Silicon Valley to Texas last year.

Additionally, a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court may look to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that legalized abortion in 1973. This has spurred questions about what happens next, including which states (and countries) would still allow abortion, as well as which states would “trigger” a ban on abortion if the ruling is overturned.

In fact, “Can you travel to another state for an abortion?” was a breakout Google search in the day following the leaked Roe v. Wade draft opinion, which means the search term spiked by more than 5,000%.

But some Republicans have called out companies for reimbursing workers who travel for reproductive care, like abortion, or for gender-affirming care. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently proposed legislation that would prohibit employers from deducting expenses related to their employees’ abortion travel costs, or gender-affirming care for young children of their employees.

These are some of the companies that have said they will cover travel costs for their employees seeking abortions, and how much some of them will reimburse.

Amazon

On Monday prior to the Supreme Court leak, Amazon AMZN, +0.05% told staff that the company will cover travel expenses for all non-life-threatening medical treatments, including abortions. The e-commerce giant, which is the second-largest private employer in the U.S. behind Walmart WMT, +0.04% , said it will reimburse up to $4,000 per year for such expenses.

The new benefit is effective retroactively to Jan. 1, and applies when the procedure is unavailable within 100 miles of the employee’s home, and virtual care is not possible. It is open to U.S. employees (including warehouse and office workers) or covered dependents enrolled in Premera or Aetna health plans.

Citigroup

Citigroup C, -0.69% also began covering travel expenses earlier this year for U.S. employees forced to go out of state for abortions. About 8,500 of the banking giant’s 65,000 U.S. employees are in Texas, which has banned abortions in the state after about six weeks of pregnancy.

“In response to changes in reproductive health care laws in certain states in the U.S., beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources,” the company said in an April filing.

DoorDash

DoorDash DASH, -1.82% also said it will begin covering travel expenses for abortion procedures after the Supreme Court document was leaked.

“It’s paramount that all DoorDash employees and their dependents covered on our health plans have access to safe, timely healthcare. This is one of our guiding principles as an employer,” a DoorDash spokesperson told MarketWatch. “Because safe abortion procedures may become severely limited in more states, DoorDash will cover certain travel-related expenses for employees who face new barriers to access and need to travel out of state for abortion-related care.”

Levi Strauss

Clothing-maker Levi Strauss LEVI, -0.85% announced Wednesday that the company will also cover travel costs for medical procedures that cannot be performed in the state their employees are in, which includes abortion.

The company says employees are “eligible for reimbursement for healthcare-related travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including those related to reproductive health care and abortion.”

Levi Strauss also noted that its employees are particularly impacted by the issue of reproductive rights, as 58% of the company’s global workforce is female. “Given what is at stake, business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees,” the company added in its announcement. “That means protecting reproductive rights.”

Microsoft

Microsoft says it will “continue to do everything we can under the law to protect our employees’ rights and support employees” in accessing critical healthcare. Those protections includes services like abortion and gender-affirming care, in the U.S., a Microsoft official told Reuters.

“This support is being extended to include travel expense assistance for these and other medical services where access to care is limited in availability in an employee’s home geographic region,” the statement continued.

Starbucks

Starbucks says employees and their dependents who are seeking reproductive health care can get it on no matter where they live, even if they have to travel for it. The benefit will apply to anyone who cannot access these services within 100 miles of where they live, and this also applies to workers’ dependents.

“Regardless of what the Supreme Court ends up deciding, we will always ensure our partners have access to quality healthcare,” wrote Sara Kelly, acting executive vice president of partner resources, in a letter posted to the Starbucks site. “Whatever healthcare choice you believe is right for you and your family, you deserve access to those services and the benefits that Starbucks provides.”

Tesla

The “People and Culture” portion of Tesla’s newly released 2021 Impact Report notes that the company wants its benefits to exceed the standards of the manufacturing industry. And that includes an expanded Safety Net program and health insurance offering that covers travel and lodging support for Tesla employees “who may need to seek healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state.”

While CEO Elon Musk did not immediately comment, he tweeted in September that he believes “government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics.”

Yelp

Yelp YELP, -0.58% , the crowd-sourced reviews platform, will cover travel expenses for both employees and their dependents who need to go out-of-state for abortions. Yelp has 4,000 employees, including 200 workers in Texas.

Yelp employees can submit the receipts for their travel expenses directly to their health insurance company, so “no one else at Yelp is ever going to know who is accessing this, or how or when, and it will be a reimbursement that comes through the insurance provider directly,” Yelp’s chief diversity officer, Miriam Warren, said in April.

“We’ve long been a strong advocate for equality in the workplace, and believe that gender equality cannot be achieved if women’s healthcare rights are restricted,” Warren also said in a statement at the time.

Other ways companies are supporting abortion access

Ride-sharing service Lyft LYFT, -2.00% announced in April that it will pay any legal fees for its drivers if they are sued for bringing women to clinics to receive abortions, which came as a result of the strict anti-abortion bills in Oklahoma and Texas. The Oklahoma bill, for example, would allow a person to sue another individual who “knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion.”

“This law is incompatible with people’s basic rights to privacy, our community guidelines, the spirit of rideshare, and our values as a company,” Lyft wrote in a blog post.

Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of competitor Uber UBER, +0.05% , tweeted that his company would support its drivers in the same way.

In 2021, Texas-based dating-app company Bumble, which prides itself on being women-founded and women-led, created a relief fund supporting the reproductive rights of women and people across the gender spectrum who seek abortions in the state.

And Match.com’s MTCH, +1.68% CEO Shar Dubey (not the company itself) also created a fund to help Match employees in Texas to seek abortions outside the state at around the same time.

Salesforce CRM, +2.22% CEO Marc Benioff also said in 2021 that the company would cover relocation costs for its Texas employees impacted by the state’s restrictive abortion laws.

“If you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state, Salesforce will help relocate you and members of your immediate family,” a Salesforce company memo stated.

297,3 Takeaways From Morningstars Conference for Fund Managers,2022-05-20 14:15:00,"It’s a tough time to be an investor. And the bad news keeps coming: Interest rates are rising, inflation is high, the war in Ukraine continues, China’s woes are deepening, and stocks and crypto are both crashing.

With turbulence and uncertainty writ large on the global stage, investors and financial advisors gathered in Chicago to discuss the outlook for markets and investing and where to find bargains. Here are three key points from the Morningstar Investment conference:

Love it or hate it, Bitcoin is here to stay

Last week, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunged, regaining a bit of ground this week. So what is the future of cryptocurrency?

Mark Casey, portfolio manager at Capital Group, said he has a paradoxical view. “Every project I studied in crypto seems like garbage to me, and it doesn’t really have a real reason to exist, other than Bitcoin, which I think could turn out to be one of the most important inventions in all of human history,” he said.

While he is optimistic about Bitcoin, he acknowledged that it is still in its early days. “I think it’s a very early invention. It’s very speculative and it could fail,” Casey said. At the same time, he added, “it’s a profoundly significant invention. I think it could be a big deal in the long term.”

As for where Bitcoin will trade in the future, Christopher Lin, portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments, said no one “has any clue of what the price of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is going to do over the next 1- 3- 5- 10 years with any sort of precision or accuracy.”

He said he is neither bullish nor bearish, “because that implies that I know what the price is going to do. I have no idea what the price is going to do. But I think the technology is extremely elegant and could be extraordinarily valuable as an evolution of software computing.”

Opportunities abound for ESG investors

The costs for clean energy solutions were “abysmal as recently as 10 years ago,” said Lucas White, portfolio manager at GMO. The technologies were so uncompetitive that they were only in use thanks to public policy support. Now, transformational changes in areas such as auto manufacturing, utilities, and water have created a heap of opportunities that no longer rely on government aid, he said.

While greenhouse-gas emissions grab most of the headlines when it comes to climate change, water is a looming risk for businesses and investors. Lisa Beauvilain, head of sustainability and ESG at Impax Asset Management, said water “is very important for climate solutions” because it “will be the manifestation of climate in many ways, too much, or too little.”

She looks at investing in water through three lenses: infrastructure, including pipes, valves and pumps; water treatment and recycling; and water utilities.

Ukraine has already beaten Russia

“Ukraine has already won this war,” said former U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation Michael McFaul. “Putin has failed in all his major objectives but one.”

Those objectives include reunifying Russia and Ukraine; “denazifying” Ukraine through regime change; demilitarization; seizing the capital Kyiv; and occupying the major cities in the east. Only progress in the eastern Donbas region appears possible at this point.

“Now [Russia] is down to changing the military objectives,” McFaul said. “It’s the defense of Donbas, the independence of Donbas. [Putin] has moved everything there to try to connect Crimea to Donbas.”

Putin has lost “the big war …but that doesn’t mean yet that he’s lost all the battles,” McFaul said, adding that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is “the Churchill of our time.”

As for what happens next, he said there were two relatively unlikely outcomes:

“I think it’s a low probability that Putin wins Donbas and pushes up to Kyiv. It isn’t zero,” he said. “One other low probability, but not zero, is that the Ukrainians push the Russians out of their country. I think that is higher than the first one.”

The most probable outcome, McFaul said, is that the fight in Donbas lasts “for several weeks, maybe months, where the borders don’t change that much, and then there are some very hard decisions that especially President Zelensky will have to make. Does he sign a cease-fire and agree to disagree about the borders or do they continue to fight?”

298,Why did crypto crash Mark Cuban compares crypto lull to the early internet,2022-05-20 12:51:00,"Mark Cuban, billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, thinks that cryptocurrency is on the same downward trend that tech and internet companies hit in the early 2000s.

Bitcoin hit a 10-month low in May, and sales of non-fungible tokens, aka NFTs, plummeted between January and March 2022.

Cuban addressed the slump in a viral Twitter TWTR, +1.93% thread. “Crypto is going through the lull that the internet went through,” he wrote.

The comparison between cryptocurrency and the early days of the internet has been made by Cuban and others including entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk before. The dot-com bubble burst in 2000 after several internet-centric companies received high levels of investment speculation, only to eventually bottom-out.

Cuban sold his company Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for $5.7 billion, just before the dot-com bust. Broadcast.com has since been discontinued.

See: How a millionaire outbid a billionaire to buy the Golden State Warriors in 2010

The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner is heavily invested and interested in the crypto and NFT space. He claims to own several thousand dollars worth of bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.88% , ethereum ETHUSD, -3.23% and dogecoin DOGEUSD, -3.26% , according to a CNBC report, and also says that 80% of his investments that aren’t on “Shark Tank” are crypto-related.

But what’s next? While NFTs have exploded in popularity over the past few years, with creators like Beeple and NBA Top Shot selling NFTs for millions of dollars, recent NFT sales have plummeted as more creators flooded the marketplace. The average daily transaction volume on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, was down more than 55% from January 2022 to March 2022, according to crypto data tracking platform Dune Analytics.

“I think that early on, you saw lots of new entrants who were enthusiastic about this, but didn’t necessarily have a grasp of the fundamentals, and I think the cooling is a reflection of that,” Jordan Birnholtz, co-founder at NFT marketplace Neon told Distributed Ledger.

Millionaire Vaynerchuk, who invested early in companies like Facebook FB, +0.83% , Twitter, Uber UBER, +0.09% , Snap SNAP, -0.28% and Venmo, told MarketWatch in July 2021 that he, like Cuban, sees NFTs and crypto following similar paths as the early internet companies in the late 1990s.

“I view NFTs exactly the way I viewed the internet in 1999. Internet stocks and their valuations were through the roof, prematurely, and a lot of things collapsed. Meanwhile, eBay EBAY, -0.99% , Google GOOG, -2.00% and Amazon AMZN, +0.05% were all there,” Vaynerchuk said.

Cuban said somethings similar in a now-deleted tweet last January. “Watching the cryptos trade, it’s EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble. EXACTLY,” he wrote. “I think BTC, ETH, a few others will be analogous to those that were built during the dotcom era, survived the bubble bursting and thrived, like AMZN, EBay, and Priceline. Many won’t.”

Cuban’s latest crypto comments come as prices for many cryptocurrencies are plummeting. Prices for bitcoin and ether were hovering around roughly half their November peaks.

299,Crypto Exchange FTX Is Pushing Into Stocks But Whos Trading Anything,2022-05-20 12:24:00,"The U.S. arm of cryptocurrency exchange FTX is pushing into stocks, the latest sign that brokerages are gunning for a model that would allow retail investors to trade a more diverse array of assets at a time when volumes have fallen precipitously.

FTX.US has made equity trading available in a testing phase to a group of customers chosen from a wait list, the company said Thursday. Integrated with FTX’s crypto trading platform, FTX Stocks will allow users to buy and sell the likes of Apple (ticker: AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) stock as well as exchange-traded funds and hundreds of other U.S. securities alongside Bitcoin and Dogecoin. Fractional share trading will be allowed for some securities.

“Our goal is to offer a holistic investing service for our customers across all asset classes,” said FTX.US President Brett Harrison in a statement. “We have created a single integrated platform for retail investors to easily trade crypto, NFTs, and traditional stock offerings through a transparent and intuitive user interface.”

FTX.US said it won’t receive payment for order flow—a controversial way that brokers such as Robinhood Markets (HOOD) subsidize free trading by routing orders through third-party trading firms instead of stock exchanges. Sam Bankman-Fried, FTX’s co-founder and chief executive, has taken a 7.6% stake in Robinhood, according to regulatory filings earlier this month.

“There is clear market demand for a new retail investment experience that offers full order routing transparency to customers and does not rely on payment for order flow,” Harrison said.

FTX.US bucks the trend of traditional finance brokerages moving into cryptocurrencies. Robinhood rolled out crypto trading to more than two million users in April, and Interactive Brokers (IBKR) is making a similar push into the world of digital assets.

Instead, with FTX, a crypto-native firm is moving into traditional finance.It isn’t the first time: FTX took a stake in IEX Group, the operator of a U.S.-regulated equities exchange, last month.

The convergence of traditional finance and crypto-native firms on trading platforms that allow users to buy and sell both equities and digital assets comes as trading volumes—both in stocks and cryptos—have taken a dive.

Amid the broad selloff in markets in 2022, retail traders seem to be staying put. The S&P 500 has tumbled almost 19% so far this year while the price of Bitcoin has declined closer to 40%.

This has manifested in trouble for brokers. Robinhood has announced plans to cut 9% of its staff amid a slowdown revealed in its quarterly earnings last month. Management reported a 10% fall in monthly active users on an annual basis. Robinhood stock is down 44% this year.

It has been even worse in the crypto world, where leading exchange Coinbase Global (COIN) reported a loss of $1.98 per share in the first quarter, far below the 1-cent loss forecast by Wall Street. Trading volumes at Coinbase plunged to $309 billion in the first quarter of the year, down 8% from the year prior and 44% below levels in the final period of 2021. Coinbase stock has tumbled 73% so far in 2022.

And there are reasons to believe things might get worse for Coinbase—and potentially others in the crypto world—as digital asset prices continue to slide. Coinbase didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment from Barron’s on whether the company was considering an expansion into stock trading.

Analysts led by Dan Dolev at Mizuho Securities wrote in a note Thursday that they estimated after a survey that the average Bitcoin holder’s cost basis is $21,000; the largest digital asset was changing hands around $30,000 on Thursday.

“If true, this means that the more Bitcoin nears such levels, the closer the average investor gets to the break-even point,” the analysts wrote. “What is the tipping point that could trigger investors to liquidate Bitcoin?” Their survey suggested the figure would be around $9,000.

Broad-based, large-scale Bitcoin sales could see a wave of retail traders leave Coinbase’s platform, hurting the company. But a note of optimism, Dolev noted, was that nearly 50% of those surveyed reported no intention to sell Bitcoin irrespective of how low it goes.

300,How to get free covid tests You can order tests now from the government,2022-05-20 11:20:00,"Americans can start ordering free COVID-19 test kits from the federal government once again.

The U.S. government is mailing out eight more rapid at-home COVID tests per household to people who order them through the United States Postal Service. You can order them online at special.usps.com/testkits or by calling 1-800-232-0233.

This marks the third time that the U.S. government has made a push to send free rapid COVID tests out to Americans through the mail. People were able to order free tests from USPS for the first time in January 2022, and again in March 2022. This brings the total number of free tests available to each household since the start of the program to 16.

“As the highly transmissible subvariants of Omicron drive a rise in cases in parts of the country, free and accessible tests will help slow the spread of the virus,” the White House said in a Tuesday statement.

The White House officially announced the third round of tests on Tuesday. But the ordering site was already live on Monday, with some people shared they had already ordered their free tests on Twitter on Monday afternoon.

Every home in the U.S. is allowed to order these tests, regardless of whether the residents ordered tests during the previous rounds of availability, according to the COVID.gov site. This time around, there is an order limit of two orders per residential address. Each order consists of four rapid antigen tests, for a total of eight tests, according to the USPS website. Your order will come in two separate packages (with four tests in each package), each with its own tracking number, and the orders will ship for free.

During the previous COVID test order windows, the free tests typically shipped within seven to 12 days of ordering, according to the White House, with most tests delivered by the USPS within 48 hours of shipping.

The Biden administration announced in January that it planned to distribute 1 billion free test kits to Americans, including 500 million available for ordering at COVIDTests.gov. The White House says that more 70 million households have visited the site to order at-home tests to be mailed directly to them. And to date, the administration says it has delivered about 350 million free tests across the country, in U.S. territories and military bases overseas.

And the latest round of free rapid at-home tests comes as U.S. COVID are trending at the highest levels seen since late November. The U.S. is averaging 95,813 cases a day, which is up 57% from two weeks ago, according to a New York Times tracker. COVID cases are up in almost every state, and the Northeast and Midwest have seen a particularly substantial uptick in new cases.

The U.S. confirmed death toll from COVID-19 currently sits at 999,850, according to the John Hopkins University tracker, edging toward 1 million. The global death toll from the pandemic rose above 6.26 million, and the World Health Organization has warned in recent months that the pandemic is not yet over.

But Musk’s gambit may cost him much more than a $1 billion breakup fee if he walks away from Twitter.

Shares of Tesla have fallen 28% since April 12, the day before Musk made his offer to Twitter’s board to take the company private. On May 19, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives, who continues to rate Tesla’s stock “outperform,” cut his price target for the shares by 40% to $1,000. Tesla’s stock closed at $709.42 on May 19.

302,Despite donations from a crypto billionaire Carrick Flynn loses Oregon primary,2022-05-20 10:32:00,"Despite nearly $11 million in donations from FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried, Democratic House candidate Carrick Flynn lost his Oregon primary race.

Early Wednesday, Flynn conceded to state Rep. Andrea Salinas, a three-term state lawmaker who is looking to become Oregon’s first Hispanic woman in Congress. The seat they were running for was in Oregon’s 6th Congressional district, which stretches from Salem to the Portland area. The area is leans Democratic, and a primary win is a good indicator for general election success in November — the district has a Democratic lean of 7 percentage points, according to FiveThirtyEight’s redistricting map.

Through his super PAC called Protect Our Future, Bankman-Fried spent money on TV ads, radio ads and direct mail services on Flynn’s behalf, making the Oregon-6 primary race the third most expensive House Democratic primary of this election cycle.

Bankman-Fried, who is 30 years old and worth almost $22 billion, donated to Flynn because of Flynn’s interest in pandemic preparedness, he told the New York Times — Flynn claims to have studied pandemics and disaster prevention at the University of Oxford.

Flynn received roughly 19% of the total vote, half of what winner Andrea Salinas received, according to the latest tally from the Washington Post. About 72% of the vote has been counted, but the race has already been called.

304,A Profit Recession Is Brewing Expert Says Hunker Down in Cash,2022-05-20 09:46:00,"If there is one person who wasn’t shocked by the massive misses in big retailers’ results this past week, it’s our longtime (but no way old) pal, Stephanie Pomboy, who heads the MacroMavens institutional economic advisory. Even though she has been coping with a (thankfully) mild case of Covid-19, she’s still as sharp, and acerbic, as ever in sizing up the current situation.

Not to lose the short-attention-span types, here are some of Steph’s searing insights:

We’re now experiencing withdrawal pangs after the massive injection of fiscal and monetary stimulus of the past two years, which actually boosted asset values more than real economic activity. With manna no longer falling from Washington, consumers are resorting to credit cards to pay the soaring costs of incidental items, such as food, energy, and rent. Companies also are getting squeezed. Producer prices are racing farther ahead of consumer prices by the biggest margin on record,

There’s also some good news. Amid the shortages of everything out there, the supply of one thing—labor—might improve. Some folks enriched by the soaring prices of assets, whether stocks, houses, or cryptocurrencies, joined the leisure class for a while. As asset prices start to deflate, some of these nouveau riche face the chastening prospect of actually having to return to work.

Pomboy says that both Wall Street and the Federal Reserve have woefully underestimated stimulus policies’ role in the current recovery. After Uncle Sam injected approximately $10 trillion in fiscal and monetary largess into the U.S. economy, nominal gross domestic product increased by about $2.3 trillion, a pathetic bang for the buck. Household net worth ballooned by $34 trillion, however, which compares with the $24 trillion U.S. economy. In effect, U.S. consumers were handed roughly two full years of income, via the increased value of their houses and of their 401(k) accounts and other securities holdings.

Now the movie is on rewind. The notion of consumers sitting on an ample cushion of savings is wrong, Pomboy says, with personal savings back to the December 2019 level. Credit-card balances, which were slashed after America received its government stimulus fix, are ramping up at a record 16% annual clip. It’s hard to imagine consumers taking on double-digit interest charges on plastic if they weren’t strapped to pay the escalating tabs at the checkout counter, gas pump, and rental office, she adds.

The stresses that dominate the everyday lives of most Americans shocked Wall Street via the first-quarter earnings reports from retailers this past week, highlighted by the 28.7% two-day swoon by Target (ticker: TGT) on Wednesday and Thursday. The soaring food, energy, and housing expenses are crowding out discretionary spending, Pomboy says. Retailers who cater to the hoi polloi can’t pass on their rising costs, resulting in massive margin squeezes that are decimating their stocks.

Yet to be seen is the effect of the now-deflating asset bubble. She passed along a chart of the JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) overlaid with the Wilshire 5000 index, which measures the broad U.S. stock market in dollars. Through the most recent reading in March, the tightening in the labor market indicated by JOLTS moved in virtual lockstep with the Wilshire.

Sometime soon, however, the reverse could happen. According to Wilshire Associates, the U.S. stock market has shed some $10.1 trillion in value, or 19.9%, this year through Thursday. The losses are relatively recent, with $7.1 trillion of that drop coming since the current quarter began, including $2.6 trillion in May, $1.7 trillion of which was torched just in Wednesday’s rout.

That doesn’t take into account the approximately trillion dollars in cryptocurrency wealth that’s evaporated globally this year, according to Goldman Sachs’ economic team, led by Jan Hatzius. Declines in household wealth point to a significant drag on spending, not so much from crypto as from conventional assets. Equities accounted for about 33% of household wealth at the end of 2021, compared with just 0.3% for crypto, they write in a client note.

Labor-force participation among younger males—crypto’s main fan base—has nearly fully recovered, the Goldman economists say. Prior academic studies have found that the wealth effect mainly affects labor-force participation among those near retirement age, who might be more apt to take their money and run.

On the surface, the jobs numbers appear to show labor demand continuing to stay ahead of supply. But peering beneath the surface, Pomboy sees confusing data. While April’s establishment survey found a solid 428,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, the separate survey of households showed a 353,000 decline in employment. While the household series (from which the headline jobless rate is derived) tends to be more volatile month to month, she has never seen such a wide split, suggesting there’s something amiss in the figures.

And recently, some big tech companies, including Meta Platforms (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Uber Technologies (UBER), have announced more restrained hiring policies. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have been creeping up, to 218,000 in the week ended May 14. That’s an historically modest level, but it’s still up from the 53-year low of 166,000, touched in March. As profit margins are squeezed, labor costs are certain to go under the microscope.

At the same time, Pomboy adds, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell wants to come across as “Volcker 2.0,” a reference to the Fed chief who vanquished inflation four decades ago with 20% interest rates and back-to-back recessions. And equity analysts have yet to seriously pare their earnings forecasts, with those for consumer-discretionary companies still pointing to 30% gains for 2022, she observes.

Pomboy’s conclusion: We’re in the early innings of an unfolding profit recession. The Fed would likely welcome wage gains if the jobs market weakens. Meanwhile, she advises investors to resist any temptation to buy the dips. Instead, she advises, hunker down in cash; the lows are still a distance away.

305,Mark Cuban supports 10000 in student loans forgiveness It has to be fixed,2022-05-20 09:31:00,"“‘We don’t want this being a perennial problem. It has to be fixed. As far as how much should be forgiven, I’m good with the Biden proposal.’”

That was billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban giving his thoughts about the student loan-debt problem in the U.S. in a Wednesday interview with Insider. Cuban says he supports the proposal backed by President Joe Biden that would forgive up to $10,000 in student loans per borrower.

The comments from Cuban represent a stark contrast to his previous views on the student-debt crisis. In the past, Cuban said that student-loan forgiveness could boost the economy, but explained that the problem should be fixed by addressing the “ridiculous tuition fees” from colleges and Universities.

See: College enrollment is falling. Here’s how it could impact the economy

“Forgiving the debt is the worst thing you can do,” Cuban said in 2015. “Because all it does is bail out the universities.”

Cuban still maintains that forgiveness is a temporary fix, and the U.S. needs to find a way to get tuitions to manageable levels.

He also added an idea on Twitter TWTR, +1.90% of creating a single, four-year, tuition-free college in every designated market area, which Cuban says would force high-cost universities to lower their total cost of attendance.

In 2014, Cuban said the student-debt crisis takes money out of the economy because those hampered with large loans, particularly younger borrowers, are making loans payments instead of using that money elsewhere.

“That’s the same money that, when you graduated, you used to move out of the house or you went out and spent money that improved the economy and helped companies grow,” Cuban said at the time.

See also: Is a graduate degree worth it? Fewer employers are requiring them; here are the pros and cons.

In 2020, Biden campaigned on the idea of $10,000 of forgiveness per borrower, but he has taken no action on the subject since taking office.

The comments from Cuban comes as Biden said on April 28 that he would release details of a plan that would addresses student-loan issues in the U.S. “in the next couple of weeks.” No announcement has been made yet, but Biden has stated that he is looking to forgive less than $50,000 in debt per borrower.

Payments on federal student loans have been paused since former President Donald Trump made the initial freeze in March 2020, in the early days of the pandemic — it was then extended twice by the Trump administration and twice again under the Biden White House.

The student-loan payment pause impacts over 43 million Americans, according to the latest data from the Education Department.

306,Its crunch time for the push to ban Congress from trading stocks,2022-05-20 09:11:00,"A China competition bill, additional Ukraine aid, further COVID-19 funding, addressing inflation and more.

U.S. lawmakers face a big to-do list before they take their August recess and then focus primarily on November’s midterm elections, but advocates for a ban on congressional trading of individual stocks sound upbeat about lawmakers managing to deliver on that issue.

“I think there’s great momentum. It’s just not public,” said Donald Sherman, senior vice president and chief counsel for the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a watchdog group.

“My understanding is that there’s a Senate compromise bill that is going to be released relatively soon. That is a compromise insofar as it combined elements from lots of people’s bills.”

Sherman said by “soon” he means “by this time next month.”

The CREW expert also pointed to some progress in the House of Representatives, following the House Administration Committee’s April 7 hearing on possible new limits on the buying and selling of individual stocks by lawmakers. Sherman said he received “pretty robust” additional questions from that panel earlier this week after testifying at that hearing — “which suggests to me that members are in the weeds on what comprehensive legislation might look like.”

“I would think that the Senate would aim to get something across the finish line before August recess, so that then the House can resolve and pass something in the fall,” Sherman added.

“This is an issue that members of Congress are either going to run on — or run from — in November. And so I think that timeline makes sense, in order to ensure that members can go back to their districts in the fall and demonstrate that they have gotten this across the finish line.”

Around 63% of all voters favor a ban on stock trading for lawmakers, with support at 69% among Democrats and 58% among Republicans, according to a recent Morning Consult/Politico poll. But the issue doesn’t rank as urgent, as Americans are focused on inflation, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, immigration, climate change and election laws, according to a Quinnipiac University survey.

The raft of bipartisan bills aiming to stop congressional trading in individual stocks has been driven in part by reports about lawmakers who bought and sold stocks in the COVID-19 pandemic’s early days after they were privy to warnings — along with news that many lawmakers have been late with their disclosures. Other reports have raised additional questions, including a MarketWatch article in January that revealed how Congress resembled a Wall Street trading desk last year, with lawmakers and their family members making an estimated total of $355 million worth of stock trades as the market SPX, -0.56% DJIA, -0.45% soared.

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat, told reporters last week that he hopes to have stock-trading legislation to vote on “this year.”

“That’s a sign that there still is some momentum there, but there’s not a desire to commit to a particular timeline,” said Jennifer Schulp, an expert from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.

“I view this as one that could pretty quickly shift,” she added, meaning the timing for a vote “could very easily turn into June or July, if it if it turns into a priority.”

Schulp, the director of financial regulation studies at the Cato’s Center for Monetary and Financial Alternatives, said she doesn’t support a ban on congressional trading of individual stocks, saying it wouldn’t restore trust in Congress or address other conflicts of interests.

She favors measures that would increase transparency, such as cutting the amount of time allowed between a trade and the required disclosure, or raising the penalties for not filing disclosures correctly. She also was a witness at the April 7 hearing.

While Congress is busy trying to tackle inflation, a baby-formula shortage and other matters, the push for a stock-trading ban is “not in contention with those other issues,” said Liz Hempowicz, director of public policy at the Project on Government Oversight (POGO), a watchdog that has lobbied for a ban that would cover lawmakers, their spouses and dependents.

“I think it’s all related, and the public needs to know that Congress can approach those kitchen-table issues with clear eyes and with the public interest at the front and center,” Hempowicz said. The alternative is Americans end up concerned about lawmakers handling a matter “with their own pocketbook in mind,” she said.

Public sentiment in favor of a ban helps make her “cautiously optimistic” on achieving it, added Hempowicz, who was among the witnesses on April 7 as well.

“Things are moving. It’s just behind the scenes,” she said.

Critics of a ban say it would discourage people from running for office, or it would be difficult to implement, especially with blind trusts being considered. Another argument is that U.S. lawmakers should understand what it’s like to invest in stocks given that they decide policy about the equity market.

Rep. Spanberger’s take, President Biden’s role

One House lawmaker who has co-sponsored one of the bills that would end congressional trading in individual stocks sounded somewhat discouraged in an interview this week, even as she seemed excited by Schumer’s comment about a Senate vote in 2022.

“Hopefully we’ll see them lead by example — faster than we might see action in the House, which is sad to me since we’re supposed to be the people’s House,” said Democratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, referring to the Senate.

“But if that’s the reality, then I look forward to them doing the right thing, and then ideally, hopefully, the House will follow suit.”

The Senate is dealing with “too many competing ideas,” but the problem in the House “is not coalescing around legislation,” she said. “The issue is House leadership doesn’t want to move this. That’s the problem in the House.”

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat, defended stock trading by lawmakers and their spouses in December, but then in January reversed herself to some extent, asking the House Administration Committee to look into a possible ban on congressional trading and saying: “I just don’t buy into that. But if members want to do that, I’m OK with that.”

Pelosi ranked as the eighth-biggest trader last year among Congress’s more than 500 members, with $12 million in buys and no sells. That’s according to MarketWatch’s January report, which used a Capitol Trades analysis of disclosures filed by members of Congress for their trading activity or for their family members’ buys and sells.

When asked what she’s doing to win over Pelosi, Spanberger said: “Getting more co-sponsors.” Her bill, introduced with Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, has attracted more than 60 co-sponsors — “quite a lot of co-sponsors for a bill that’s not imminently coming for a vote,” she said.

The Virginia Democrat decried seeing fellow lawmakers buy shares in pharmaceutical or cleaning-supply companies during the onset of the COVID pandemic, as well as buying stock in a defense company that’s “going to be producing massive amounts of specific weaponry for a war in Ukraine that we knew was coming.”

“The fact that there are members of Congress who think they’re ‘right’ to be able to buy stocks, which equates to profiting off that information, is to me just unconscionable,” Spanberger said.

“I’m continuing to build up a coalition of people who believe that this reform is necessary. But I can’t change everybody’s minds. And sadly there’s numbers behind why some people might not be inclined to support it.”

An additional hurdle could be the 50-50 Senate’s filibuster rule, in which 60 votes are required to end debate on most items, so the minority party is able to stymie the majority’s efforts. But some Republican senators have backed bills focused on congressional trading, including Tennessee’s Marsha Blackburn, Montana’s Steve Daines, South Carolina’s Lindsey Graham and Missouri’s Josh Hawley.

Another watchdog group that’s pushing for a ban is planning to get President Joe Biden involved, hoping that could spark action.

“We will send a letter requesting that he push this through and basically follow his campaign promise to push for laws where Congress is not influenced by their personal financial holdings,” said Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics and general counsel at the Campaign Legal Center (CLC). That refers to a Biden campaign pledge to work with Congress to enact laws that would stop lawmakers from being influenced by those holdings.

That letter, with signatures from a range of groups, is likely to go out this week or next week, according to Payne.

The CLC expert ties passage of 2012’s STOCK Act to a strong nudge from then-President Barack Obama during a State of the Union address. That law requires disclosures of stock trades by lawmakers, and it aims to help prevent politicians from insider trading, but it’s viewed as insufficient by some watchdog groups.

“It was recognized” a decade ago that the president could deliver “a push from outside of the legislature, and that’s what needs to happen now,” Payne said.

“This problem of perceived conflicts of interest with stock trading is not going away, and it will get worse unless Congress acts right away,” he added.

307,Bitcoin Is Rising Crypto Traders Are Still Preparing for the Worst,2022-05-20 08:41:00,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were rallying on Friday as digital assets continued a recent outperformance of stocks, though there are signs in the derivatives market that crypto traders are preparing for a move downward.

The price of Bitcoin rose 4% over the past 24 hours to around $30,500. The largest crypto was still trading around the lowest point all year, but comfortably higher than recent levels below $30,000 and well above near $26,000 low reached in last week’s cryptocurrency crash.

“Bitcoin is hovering around the $30,000 level as investors continue to shy away from stocks,” wrote Edward Moya, an analyst at broker Oanda. “A weaker dollar and bear market stock fears are making Bitcoin attractive again.”

Bitcoin and its peers should theoretically trade independently of mainstream financial markets, but have largely shown themselves to be correlated with other risk-sensitive assets—like stocks, and especially tech stocks—over the past year. Some of that correlation has recently faded, with Bitcoin actually outperforming stock indexes like the S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq this week.

The leading digital asset has gained almost 10% since Monday, when it changed hands around $29,500. By comparison, based on stock-index futures indicating the U.S. market open on Friday, the S&P 500 has lost 2% this week while the Nasdaq-100 is down 3%.

Stocks are in a rough patch, with the Nasdaq remaining deep in bear market territory—down 28% this year—and the S&P 500 flirting with a bear market.

“Bitcoin looks poised to consolidate [around $30,000], but bulls should be happy to see prices are not mimicking what happens with the stock market,” Moya wrote.

Bitcoin is trading at its lowest levels since July 2021, and remains at less than half its all-time high near $69,000 reached in November. By comparison, the S&P 500 closed on Thursday at its lowest level since March 2021.

The leading digital asset is recovering ever-so slowly from its recent crash, which was largely linked to spillover from a stock market selloff and fueled by the collapse of a systemically-important stablecoin meant to be pegged to the U.S. dollar.

“It seems the fallout from all the stablecoin drama that sent cryptos sharply lower is finally fading,” wrote Moya.

That stablecoin, TerraUSD, continued to trade at a severe discount to the dollar—7 cents. Luna, a related token that through an arbitrage market mechanism is meant to keep Terra on its peg, was changing hands at one-hundredth of a penny. It was at $80 two weeks ago, when it was one of the largest digital assets.

But there remain indications in the derivatives market that crypto traders are readying for—or even betting on—another major downward move in Bitcoin prices.

“The put/call ratio for Bitcoin open interest hit a 12-month high of 0.72 yesterday, indicating bearish sentiment among investors,” wrote a team at crypto market intelligence firm Delphi Digital.

A put/call ratio describes the environment of bets in the options market; puts are bets on prices moving lower, while calls are bets that prices will jump.

“A high put/call ratio indicates that investors are speculating whether bitcoin will continue to sell off, or it could mean investors are hedging their portfolios against a downward move,” the analysts at Delphi said. “Last April, the put/call ratio traded as high as 0.96 before Bitcoin’s price dropped over 50% in May 2021.”

Beyond Bitcoin, the crypto Ether was even more buoyant. The token underpinning the Ethereum blockchain network rose 5% to above $2,050, well above last week’s trough below $1,800, but still down by nearly one-third from two weeks ago.

Smaller cryptos, or altcoins, also gained. Solana rose 4%, Cardano was up 2%, and Avalanche jumped 7%. Memecoins, which were initially intended as internet jokes rather than serious cryptocurrency prospects, were similarly in the green; Dogecoin and Shiba Inu both rallied 2%.

308,Will the US Issue its Own Crypto The Prospects Look Dim,2022-05-20 08:36:00,"While some countries charge ahead with plans to issue digital money, in the U.S. the prospects for a central-bank digital currency are looking increasingly remote.

On Wednesday, a letter signed by every Republican on the House Financial Services Committee went to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, expressing concerns about how a digital currency could affect banks, monetary policy and privacy rights. It came in advance of a hearing on the topic scheduled for next Thursday.

Republicans’ concerns are important because Fed officials have strongly suggested they need a new law authorizing a digital currency’s issuance. In a divided Congress, without support from the GOP, a U.S. project couldn’t move forward.

The Fed itself is still in the early stages of evaluating whether a digital dollar makes sense. In January, it released a white paper with potential pros and cons of the project with public comment due Friday. At the same time, a team at the Boston Fed has worked on code that could underpin a digital dollar if the U.S. chose to move forward.

Of course, most dollar-denominated commerce already occurs digitally. Unlike bank deposits, which are liabilities, a digital currency would essentially be a digital form of a bank note. Consumers could potentially hold the dollars in wallets on a phone, pay a merchant with a simple scan, and transfer the money instantly with little or no cost. Some proponents of the idea think a digital currency could increase financial inclusion for unbanked Americans or lower the cost of international money transfers, among other potential use cases.

According to the Atlantic Council, 87 countries representing more than 90% of world gross-domestic product are exploring a digital currency. The major economy that is the furthest along is China, which already is allowing some citizens to use a digital yuan.

China’s lead on the matter has been a major concern in the past for Republicans, some of whom claimed the digitization of the yuan could make it a threat to the global dominance of the dollar.

However, more recently, some Republicans have suggested that the private sector, through the development of dollar-denominated stablecoins, should take the lead.

The House Republicans’ letter echoed that view, calling stablecoins a “potential cornerstone of a modern payment system.” The letter also expressed doubt that a digital dollar would increase financial inclusion, concerns that it could diminish privacy, and worries about the impact on monetary policy.

If political gridlock reins, the clear winners are dollar-denominated stablecoin providers, like Circle Internet Financial and Paxos Trust Co. Those companies are facing problems of their own as U.S. agencies and lawmakers try to determine how they should be regulated, but they already have a working digital-dollar product. Circle is seeking to go public through a SPAC merger with Concord Acquisition Corp. (ticker: CND), pending approval by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Republicans may yet come around to the idea of a digital dollar, and the Fed will still be able to continue down the road of developing research and technology while it waits for lawmakers to pull the trigger. But for now, political gridlock could put a U.S. digital currency out of reach.

309,4 tricks for saving money on a family vacation,2022-05-20 05:02:00,"This article is reprinted by permission from NerdWallet.

My family didn’t travel much when I was a kid, but when we did, my parents jumped through hoops to cut costs.

On a trip to Disney World, DIS, -1.25% for example, our family of six switched hotels. Every. Night. My mom worked for a hotel chain and could get one free night per property.

Did my parents save money? Yes. Did it add to the mental burden of traveling with four kids? Absolutely.

As an adult now, planning a trip with my own child, I fully understand how expensive — and hard — it is to travel with kids. Planning and packing requires accounting for naps, snacks, tantrums and blowouts. And you’re budgeting for extra airfare, a bigger rental car and additional lodging.

You can save money on family travel and still have peace of mind. To find out how, I consulted two experts. Here’s what they had to say.

Pay with points

The secret of savvy travelers? They don’t actually pay for airfare and lodging. Instead, they use rewards credit cards to turn everyday purchases into free flights and hotel rooms.

“Make your money work for you,” says Preethi Harbuck, a San Francisco Bay Area-based travel writer behind the blog Local Passport Family. Harbuck’s family of seven (soon to be eight) travels almost exclusively on credit card points. “There are more expenditures when you have kids but you can leverage those into greater benefits.”

Card hopping can net you major points thanks to signup bonuses but can be hard to manage, says Jamie Harper, mother of four and author of the travel blog Fly by the Seat of Our Pants. To keep things manageable, stick to one or two primary cards.

Harper and her husband rotate between Hyatt, H, -2.33% Marriott MAR, -1.55% and Hilton HLT, -1.06% cards, which offer perks like free breakfast, Wi-Fi and anniversary nights.

Pack light — and smart

Overpacking can be a disaster on multiple fronts. First, you have to lug all that stuff with you and keep track of it along the way. The odds of a lost blankie are high.

Second, checked bags are expensive — around $30 to $35 per bag, each way.

Harbuck and her family stick to either one checked bag or a few smaller carry-ons. Rather than a fresh outfit for each person, each day, they rewear outfits and typically do laundry on each trip.

“Pack clothing that’s lightweight, packs up well and dries quickly,” she says, noting that wool items are great for colder weather.

Having layers is crucial, too. Skimp on this and you may wind up spending $50 per kid on souvenir sweatshirts to keep them warm, Harper says.

Choose activities mindfully

Pack your itinerary with free things to do, like local parks, hikes, beaches or free museums.

You can also tap into perks included with memberships you already have — to your local zoo or children’s museum — or invest in passes that you can use again and again.

When you do pay for experiences and excursions, consider your family’s life stage. Rather than taking your toddler to an art museum, for example, opt for an outdoor sculpture garden where they can run around or a museum tailored toward children with plenty of interactive features at their level.

Your family’s travel priorities should also guide you, Harbuck says. Learning about a place’s culture and history is important for her family, so they spend money on activities that achieve that goal and skip more popular tourist attractions.

“We’ve been to London several times but have never ridden the London Eye,” she says. “It doesn’t help me feel connected to the culture, and it’s super expensive.”

Pack snacks, grocery shop

There’s no rule that says you have to dine out for every meal when you’re on vacation.

Instead, pick one meal a day to eat out. Lunch is a good option, as it’s typically cheaper than dinner (which in some countries starts later than most kids’ bedtimes). By packing your supper or eating at home, you avoid an overpriced meal where children are either melting down or asleep at the table.

Harbuck’s family hits up local markets to stock up on food when they land in a new city. Taking a road trip? Keep a cooler with food for rest-stop picnics.

“If we don’t eat out twice, we’re saving $100 a day — and that’s the cheapest possible meal,” Harper says, noting her kids are picky eaters. “We spent $7 per kid on buttered pasta once. It was the worst experience ever. They didn’t even eat it.”

310,How TerraUSD a Digital Token Designed to be Stable Fueled a Crypto Crash,2022-05-19 21:05:00,"Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies went from bad to worse as selling pressure spread across the tech landscape. But the latest crypto crash was also fueled by stablecoins, a type of token that’s supposed to hold up when everything else tanks.

Stablecoins are designed to maintain a fixed value, typically at $1 per token. But a fast-growing “algorithmic” stablecoin called TerraUSD collapsed this past week to a few pennies on the dollar. That appears to have shaken confidence in the largest stablecoin, Tether. Prices for Tether, or USDT, dipped to 95 cents for a few hours on Thursday, then rebounded to nearly a dollar.

The episode could shake the foundations of crypto. Stablecoins are the bedrock of trading and lending activities, providing liquidity to individual traders, funds, and market makers on both centralized exchanges and decentralized-finance, or DeFi, networks. More than 90% of trading volume in crypto occurs in stablecoins, according to CoinMarketCap. Without stablecoins doing their job—holding their dollar pegs through periods of extreme turmoil—the crypto market may face a loss of confidence, affecting trading activity and prices for tokens ranging from Bitcoin to Dogecoin.

“USDT de-pegging is alarming for all cryptocurrency markets,” says Clara Medalie, research director at Kaiko, a crypto data firm.

This isn’t just a concern for traders and firms in the $1.3 trillion crypto market. Regulators worry that if stablecoins take off as privately issued digital money, they could pose risks to broader markets and monetary policies. A run on a stablecoin could, in theory, lead to heavy selling in assets held as reserves for coin issuers, such as commercial short-term debt. Stablecoins could also substitute for the dollar in international commerce and cross-border payments—making it harder for governments to keep tabs on monetary policies and capital flows.

“The outstanding stock of stablecoins is growing at a very rapid rate, and we really need a consistent federal framework,” U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen told the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday, partly in reference to TerraUSD.

Bitcoin’s high volatility and drawbacks as a medium of exchange opened a door for stablecoins to step through. Tether and USD Coin, or USDC, have soared in issuance over the past few years. They’re now worth a combined $130 billion, making them the third- and fourth-largest cryptos, behind Bitcoin and Ether.

“Once you’re in the ecosystem, stablecoins allow you to act as though you have U.S. dollars, when really you own crypto,” says Stéphane Ouellette, CEO of crypto derivatives broker FRNT Financial.

The coins serve numerous purposes: Traders use them to maintain liquidity between transactions and to buy other cryptos; they also play a key role in market-making and are widely used by hedge funds and other proprietary trading firms. Tether, in particular, is the most systemically important; it’s the basis for thousands of “pair trades” on exchanges and DeFi platforms, along with “smart contracts” for lending and borrowing cryptos.

Demand for stablecoins is so high as collateral for trading and borrowing that yields top 8% on many DeFi platforms and centralized sites—and even touched 20% for TerraUSD.

There’s also profit in stablecoins, and it’s attracting banks, payment companies, and fintechs to the space. The bank Silvergate Capital (ticker: SI) aims to revive the stablecoin project originally started by Meta Platforms ’ (FB) Facebook, part of a broad push into crypto banking and brokerage products. Visa (V) is offering settlement services in USDC. The company backing USDC, Circle Internet Financial, is trying to go public via a special-purpose acquisition vehicle, or SPAC, called Concord Acquisition (CND). Recent investors in Circle include BlackRock (BLK) and Fidelity Investments.

The New Crypto Dollars

Like every other cryptocurrency, stablecoin transactions are recorded on blockchains such as Ethereum. While transaction fees may be steep, the coins are well suited for peer-to-peer transfers that bypass traditional banking systems, cutting out intermediaries. That’s one reason they’re often used for remittances or cross-border payments. Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine, Kyiv began welcoming crypto donations in three tokens, including Tether.

There are basically two kinds of stablecoins: asset-backed and algorithmic. Tether and USDC are the two largest asset-backed coins. The companies backing the coins aim to maintain their pegs by holding reserves equivalent to their outstanding issuance. Every time a dollar’s worth of the coins is minted, the companies are supposed to buy a dollar’s worth of reserves; when the coins are redeemed, those reserves may be sold.

Algorithmic coins like TerraUSD are more complex. They aim to maintain their pegs through arbitrage and incentive mechanisms involving other cryptocurrencies. When the price deviates from a dollar, traders can profit through a swap with another token. That is supposed to prevent the price of the stablecoin from deviating much above or below a dollar.

Breaking the Buck

TerraUSD relied on a complex mechanism of minting and burning another token, LUNA, to maintain its dollar peg. A cascade of selling in TerraUSD destabilized its peg, however, and crashed prices for LUNA.

Crypto entrepreneur Do Kwon, based in Korea, had tried to shore up LUNA and TerraUSD with plans to purchase up to $10 billion worth of Bitcoin as collateral through the “Luna Foundation Guard.” Before the crash, the foundation held $3.5 billion in Bitcoin.

The selling pressure arose from withdrawals on a DeFi lending protocol called Anchor that offered yields of 20% on TerraUSD deposits. Roughly $14 billion worth of TerraUSD was deposited in Anchor before the crash. Less than $200 million is left.

“I understand the last 72 hours have been extremely tough on all of you—know that I am resolved to work with every one of you to weather this crisis, and we will build our way out of this,” Kwon said on Twitter on Wednesday. “As we begin to rebuild [Terra], we will adjust its mechanism to be collateralized.”

Still, the Luna Foundation Guard may be running out of money. Its reserves are down to less than $90 million worth of cryptos, and it holds no Bitcoin in its wallet. The crash also took a toll on the Terra blockchain, which briefly shut down on Thursday “to prevent governance attacks,” according to Terra’s Twitter feed. The world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance, also suspended trading in TerraUSD and LUNA.

Some crypto participants say that while the episode has been painful, it signals that the market is actually functioning. “The market flushed out a weakly designed system, and the speculators that were behind it took a financial hit,” says Ryan Selkis, CEO of crypto data firm Messari.

Yet the crash had contagion effects. Luna’s stockpiling of Bitcoin rippled across other cryptos. Traders expecting a meltdown in TerraUSD appear to have sold Bitcoin, contributing to the token’s declines. That, in turn, weakened demand across crypto markets, which lost more than $400 billion in market cap as scores of tokens declined by more than 20%, including Bitcoin, Ether, Cardano, and Solana.

USDT hasn’t emerged without a black eye, either, underscoring how contagion from one crypto can spread to others and the broader market.

In theory, USDT shouldn’t deviate far from its peg. Tether Ltd., the company backing the token, says USDT is “backed 100%” by reserves at a one-to-one ratio, and promises that investors can always redeem its tokens for an equivalent amount of real money. If a hedge fund were to send the company one million USDT tokens, for instance, the company would send the fund $1 million, even if the price differs on secondary markets.

The token also relies on arbitrage mechanisms with market makers and trading firms to hold its peg. If the price of USDT falls by even a fraction of a penny on exchanges like Coinbase or FTX, institutional traders can buy USDT at a discount and redeem it with the company, profiting off the spread, or difference, to a buck.

Those mechanics do appear to have worked. The coin was at about 95 cents on the dollar at 3:30 a.m. in New York on Thursday, but by 9 a.m. it was above 99 cents.

Why did the price get so low? Overnight selling pressure before banks opened for business may have contributed—leaving a gap between selling on the secondary market and redemptions with Tether. Moreover, Tether redeems tokens only with “eligible contract participants” such as proprietary trading firms, and it isn’t automatic.

Some market participants say USDT’s loss of dollar peg wasn’t a deal breaker for the token. “The market is functioning, and it’s expected to see minor de-risking of other stablecoins following the Terra de-peg,” says John Kramer, director of trading at market maker GSR.

Ouellette, who deals in Tether through his derivatives firm and a separate hedge fund, describes the situation as a “little spooky,” but adds that it looked like typical “arbitrage friction,” exacerbated by hedge funds that had tried to attack USDT and profit off a decline.

Still, Tether hasn’t inspired confidence with its limited disclosures and reserve practices. Based in the British Virgin Islands, Tether issues a periodic “assurance opinion” on its reserves from a Cayman Islands auditor. The last one was from December. In it, Tether said that 84% of its reserves were in cash and equivalents, Treasuries, short-term deposits, and commercial paper. The rest consisted of $4.1 billion in “secured loans”; $3.6 billion in “corporate bonds, funds, and precious metals”; and $5 billion in “other investments,” including “digital tokens.”

The company said Thursday that it had reduced its holdings of commercial paper by 50% over the past six months, and now holds the majority of its assets in Treasuries.

Still, Tether has run into legal troubles, settling charges last year with New York state and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission over its reserves and disclosure practices.

“Unlike algorithmic stablecoins, Tether holds a strong, conservative, and liquid portfolio,” a Tether spokesperson tells Barron’s. Tether has maintained its stability “through multiple black-swan events” and never refused a redemption, the spokesperson adds. Tether added in a statement that “it is business as usual” and was processing more than $2 billion in redemption requests “without issue.”

Crypto Rules Are Coming

The volatility in stablecoins may only build momentum to bring some rules and supervision to the space.

The Biden administration, for one, wants coin issuers under federal supervision, potentially even carrying FDIC deposit insurance. Biden called on Congress to pass supervisory rules for stablecoins in a recent executive order on crypto.

Congress is also working on a variety of rules for stablecoins; a draft bill in the Senate would establish a process for banks and credit unions to issue stablecoins, among other measures. Sen. Patrick Toomey (R., Pa.) recently introduced a framework for regulating “payment stablecoins,” though it wouldn’t address algorithmic coins, which are looking far less stable than asset-backed coins.

U.S. regulators and lawmakers have expressed several concerns. One is about the liquidity and quality of issuers’ reserve assets—whether they can readily meet redemption requests in a panic scenario. Another growing concern is contagion to broader financial markets if there’s a run on a major stablecoin like USDT.

Many trading firms hold large amounts of USDT for market-making and liquidity. Those institutions need to be confident that USDT is fully backed and that they’ll be fully repaid in dollars when redeeming large amounts. “I don’t know too many institutional market participants that are concerned about the reserves in Tether,” says Selkis.

Yet if those trading firms were to lose faith in Tether, they may quickly try to sell their holdings on secondary markets. Without a government backstop like the Fed or Treasury Department, USDT would be at the mercy of the market, potentially causing shockwaves to other cryptos and trading at brokerages from Coinbase Global (COIN) to PayPal Holdings (PYPL).

“If you’re a regulator, I think what they’re worried about is not that the crypto community goes poof; it’s that the losses at Coinbase then feed to PayPal and then feed to a bank,” says Bryan Routledge, a professor of finance at Carnegie Mellon University.

Stability Is All Relative

If anyone might emerge stronger from this, it’s Circle, the company backing USDC. Based in the U.S., Circle says its reserves now consist of cash and Treasuries, fully backing every token.

CEO Jeremy Allaire said on Thursday that the company had issued $1 billion in USDC over the prior 24 hours, which he attributed to a “flight to quality” as investors sought issuers that were fully backed and transparent. “There are others that have chosen not to participate in a regulatory framework,” he said. “Naturally, there are more questions about that.”

Circle, of course, is trying to be a model citizen as it aims to go public. Its revenue model centers partly on generating income from reserve assets and lending activities. Rising interest rates should boost the yield on its reserves. The firm is awaiting regulatory approval for its SPAC merger from the Securities and Exchange Commission. Allaire said he expects the merger to be completed later this year.

Circle probably won’t be profitable for at least another year, though. It’s projecting adjusted operating profits of $677 million in 2023, assuming that USDC in circulation reaches $220 billion, with 5,000 institutional accounts and $6.4 billion in lending volume. More shocks to the crypto ecosystem would probably derail those plans, and Circle’s profits.

311,A Major Stablecoin Issuer Aims to Go Public The Crypto Crash Will Make It Tougher,2022-05-19 18:58:00,"Circle Internet Financial, backer of the “stablecoin” USD Coin, says it remains committed to its $9 billion merger with Concord Acquisition.

But getting the deal through the Securities and Exchange Commission is turning into a long and arduous slog, and the crypto market crash may only be making it tougher.

Stablecoins are digital tokens typically pegged to a dollar and backed by reserve assets. USD Coin, or USDC, is the second-largest stablecoin on the market, after Tether, worth $52 billion in outstanding issuance.

Jeremy Allaire, Circle’s co-founder and CEO, said on Wednesday that he had initially thought a merger with Concord (ticker: CND), a special-purpose acquisition company, would take six to eight months. Circle announced the deal with Concord in July 2021, valuing the fintech at $4.5 billion.

Ten months later, the SPAC merger is still awaiting regulatory approval at the SEC. In the meantime, Circle agreed to revised terms with Concord that boosted the fintech’s enterprise value to $9 billion.

Circle and Concord now have until Dec. 8 to complete the merger, with the potential to extend that date to Jan. 31, 2023.

If the deal falls apart, it would hardly be the only one dying in this market. The number of busted de-SPACs–where a blank-check company agrees to a merger with a business but then terminates the deal–has increased this year to about 20, according to data from SPAC Research. This is up from 19 terminated deals in all of 2021.

Allaire said Circle is still all-in on the merger, adding that it’s “a complex business, a new type of financial platform.” The company is moving through the process with the SEC, he added, providing no further insight into timing. Circle is also seeking a federal bank charter.

USD Coin’s issuance has rocketed 262% over the past 12 months, making it the fourth largest token by market value, after Bitcoin, Ether, and Tether. It’s widely used for liquidity in crypto markets, held by brokerages, hedge funds, and individual traders. It also serves as collateral for borrowing on decentralized-finance or DeFi platforms.

Circle isn’t yet profitable, according to its regulatory filings. But the company is projecting adjusted operating profits of $677 million in 2023, assuming that USD Coin in circulation reaches $220 billion, with 5,000 monthly active customers and $6.4 billion in lending volume

Some of the slowdown at the SEC may be due to more scrutiny of SPAC deals overall. Accounting guidance issued by the SEC in 2020 changed how SPACs handle warrants. The regulator also proposed new regulations this past March that would make the disclosures and obligations around SPACs more like those of an IPO. SPACs, under the proposed rules, will have to disclose details about sponsors’ compensation and potential conflicts of interest.

This year, just 66 SPACs have gone public as of May 11, valued at $11.4 billion, according to Dealogic. This compares to 315 blank check companies that collected $102 billion for the same time period in 2021.

But the crypto crash and collapse of the TerraUSD stablecoin may only make the SEC even more reluctant to approve Circle’s merger with Concord.

Stablecoin rules are likely to emerge in Washington, either through bills now in Congress or orders from the Biden administration.

“We are now working with Congress to advance legislation to help ensure stablecoins are resilient to risks that could endanger consumers or the broader financial system,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a recent speech.

Were the SEC to give Circle a greenlight, it could be viewed as a seal of regulatory approval–something that isn’t likely under the SEC’s Democratic Chair Gary Gensler, who has been critical of cryptos and called for tougher rules. In April, Gensler said the agency plans to exercise more oversight of the crypto market and warned that stablecoins are so critical “that a loss of the peg or a failure of the issuer could imperil one or more trading platforms, and may reverberate across the wider crypto ecosystem.”

Allaire said Circle has benefited from the TerraUSD collapse and a brief spell of Tether losing its dollar peg. Circle’s outstanding issuance picked up 7% in the wake of those events, while Tether’s issuance has fallen by around $9 billion.

Terra and “that whole ecosystem was a source of froth,” Allaire said. “Our view was this was a house of cards,” he added, saying a “flight to quality has taken place.”

Whether the SEC agrees with that sentiment remains to be seen. An SEC spokesman declined to comment.

312,Crypto crash will have limited impact on US household wealth and labor supply Goldman Sachs,2022-05-19 17:42:00,"The global cryptocurrency market lost over $300 billion last week and about $1.7 trillion in the past seven months. But the impact on U.S. household wealth, spending and the labor supply are likely to be limited, according to Goldman Sachs.

The crypto market capitalization has plunged to around $1.3 trillion as of Thursday, from an all-time high of more than $3 trillion in November, according to CoinGecko.

U.S. households own about one-third of the global crypto market, or about $423 billion as of Thursday, according to the rough estimate by analysts at Goldman Sachs, based on various surveys. The recent decline in the crypto market is “very small” relative to U.S. households’ net worth, which stood at $150 trillion in 2021, the bank’s analysts wrote in a Thursday note.

Crypto holdings account for only 0.3% of U.S. households’ net worth, while the recent price drop of digital assets have reduced U.S. household wealth by about $300 billion, according to the analysts. In contrast, corporate equities account for about 33% of households’ net worth at the end of 2021, while their recent losses have likely erased $8 trillion of that wealth.

“These patterns imply that equity price fluctuations are the main driver of changes in household net worth, while cryptocurrencies are only a marginal contributor,” the analysts wrote.

Therefore, a decrease in cryptocurrencies’ value would have a minor impact on the aggregate spending, according to the report.

The analysts also expect the crypto downturn to have a limited effect on labor supply.

In general, the decline in household wealth may incentivize some workers who left the labor market during the pandemic to return, they noted.

However, crypto investors are predominantly young males, a demographic group whose labor-force participation has been less affected by wealth fluctuations, the analysts wrote. Meanwhile, the labor-force participation rate of young males has already returned to pre-pandemic level, Goldman said.

The analysis indicates that the wealth generated from cryptocurrency has likely played an insignificant role in discouraging labor supply, thus the recent fall in its price will provide a limited boost to labor supply.

313,Retail stock woes hit consumer sector ETFs as SampP 500 nears bear market territory,2022-05-19 17:29:00,"Hello! It’s been a brutal week for consumer-sector stocks while the S&P 500 index is edging closer to bear market territory.

“My indicators suggest that the bear-market move can keep its hold through the summer months,” says Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, in this week’s ETF Wrap. She also says her recently launched Fairlead Tactical Sector ETF may help “protect downside in this type of environment.”

Please send feedback and tips to christine.idzelis@marketwatch.com. You can also follow me on Twitter at @cidzelis and find me on LinkedIn.

In a brutal week for retail stocks, the defensive consumer-staples sector was not spared.

The Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund XLP, +0.14% fell 6.4% Wednesday, while the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY, -2.38% dropped 6.5%, according to FactSet data.

The carnage came within a broader stock-market slump, with the S&P 500 SPX, -0.60% falling 4% Wednesday, for its biggest daily drop since June 2020. The S&P 500’s consumer-staples and consumer-discretionary sectors on Wednesday booked their biggest percentage drop since March 2020, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

“We’re in a bear-market move,” with sharp relief rallies presenting “better selling opportunities until you get a long-term bottom,” said Katie Stockton, founder and managing partner of Fairlead Strategies, in a phone interview. “My indicators suggest that the bear-market move can keep its hold through the summer months.”

Stockton is the portfolio manager for the recently launched Fairlead Tactical Sector ETF TACK, +0.10% , an active U.S. equity fund that uses a systematic strategy and is rebalanced monthly. The fund, which began trading March 23, is so far faring better than the S&P 500 index.

Shares of the Fairlead Tactical Sector ETF are down 1.8% this month through Wednesday, after falling 3.3% in April, FactSet data show. That compares with the S&P 500’s 8.8% drop last month and a decline of 5% in May through Wednesday.

“Over the course of the fund’s life, it’s gotten increasingly risk off,” said Stockton, partly through a more defensive sector positioning that includes exposure to consumer staples. She said the ETF can help “protect downside in this type of environment” where stocks are selling off.

The S&P 500 was trading down Thursday afternoon, nearing bear market territory, which it would enter with a close of about 3,837, according to Dow Jones Market data.

The Fairlead Tactical Sector ETF, which invests in SPDR ETFs, has shifted to a 50% position in short-term Treasuries SPTS, +0.08% , long-term Treasuries SPTL, +1.11% and gold GLD, +0.03% , Stockton said, while the fund’s sectors exposures are “fairly defensive,” including consumer staples XLP, +0.14% , utilities XLU, +0.11% , real estate XLRE, +1.03% and energy XLE, +0.06% .

Consumer staples is considered a defensive sector but it has taken a beating this week, as earning misses reported by Target Corp. TGT, +1.36% and Walmart Inc. WMT, +0.05% have increased investors’ recession fears amid concern that high inflation may be squeezing Americans’ spending.

The Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF VDC, -0.02% , Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF RHS, -0.07% and Fidelity Covington Trust MSCI Consumer Staples Index ETF FSTA, -0.05% all fell more than 6% Wednesday, according to FactSet data.

Walmart, a retail giant in the S&P 500 index’s consumer-staples sector, is down around 19% this week, based on Thursday afternoon trading levels, FactSet data show, at last check. And Target, a department-store chain in the S&P 500’s battered consumer discretionary sector, has this week tanked around 30%, based on Thursday afternoon trading.

So far this year, the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund has plunged 30% through Wednesday, far exceeding the nearly 7% decline for the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund over the same period, FactSet data show.

“Inflation always hits the lower income cohorts hardest and first,” according to a May 18 markets note from The Sevens Report. Walmart’s earnings results “imply that’s starting to happen now,” the report says, warning that “a further economic slowdown” risks weighing more broadly on the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund.

The Sevens suggested that Walmart’s results “somewhat refutes the ‘defensive’ nature of consumer staples, at least partially,” while also pointing to the consumer shift that the retailer saw toward brand names instead of “private label” as a sign of inflation weighing on consumers.

“The shift from brand names to generic is a potential threat” to Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -0.32% , which is the biggest holding in the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLP), according to the Sevens Report. “We don’t think it invalidates Consumer Staples as a defensive play, but it does imply an equal-weight ETF might be better than XLP to diversify the risk a bit more.”

The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF RHS, -0.07% “equal weights the consumer staples in the S&P 500, providing more diversification against changing consumer trends,” according to the report. Shares of the Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight Consumer Staples ETF are down around 3% this year through Wednesday, FactSet data show.

314,Analysis Musks ESG attack spotlights 35 trillion industry confusion,2022-05-20 19:00:16,"
LONDON/BOSTON, May 20 (Reuters) - Elon Musk's rejection of environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) scores as a ""scam"" highlights how Wall Street's hottest investment trend that encompasses some $35 trillion in assets means different things to different people.

The chief executive of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) lashed out on Wednesday against S&P Global Inc (SPGI.N) after the electric car maker was dropped from its flagship ESG index while it added some companies whose activities are harmful to the environment, such as oil and gas producers.

Musk took to Twitter to express his frustration with the move ""despite Tesla doing more for the environment than any company ever!"" He added that ESG ""has been weaponized by phoney social justice warriors.""


S&P Dow Jones Indices senior director Margaret Dorn told Reuters that Tesla had been excluded from the index because its score declined slightly just as the scores of other automakers had improved. Tesla was not excluded because S&P executives decided to kick the company out of the index over a particular issue, she added. read more

While Tesla's cars contribute to lower carbon emissions, its ESG score had ""fallen behind"" in other aspects, such as poor working conditions at its U.S. Fremont factory, claims of racial discrimination and its handling of a U.S. government probe into multiple deaths and injuries linked to its autopilot technology.

Sustainable investing - taking into account ESG factors in portfolio selection - has exploded in recent years, reaching $35.3 trillion by the start of 2020, according to the Global Sustainable Investment Alliance.

Half a dozen investment managers interviewed by Reuters said Musk's spat with S&P illustrates how confusion still reigns over how many investors and executives view the industry.

Some, like Musk, believe the ratings should reward companies that do the most for the planet and society. Others, including firms like S&P that produce the scores, say they are meant to show how much risk a company's stock faces from ESG factors.

This explains why some companies that are major contributors to climate change, such as Exxon Corp (XOM.N), are allowed to stay in an ESG index if they can show they are taking actions to reduce that risk.

""Ultimately ESG is a way of identifying and trying to quantify risk. So it's basically risk mitigation,"" said Chi Chan, portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. ""Effectively Musk is conflating ESG with sustainability.""

Mark Tinker, chief investment officer at Toscafund Hong Kong, said Musk ""rightly pointed out"" that societal and corporate governance considerations are being used ""for political driven cancelling"" and that a company's contribution to the environment can also ""mean what you want it to.""

""The whole thing is very subjective,"" Tinker said.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on behalf of the company or Musk.

S&P published the change in its ESG index on April 22. But it was not until May 18, a day after Horn wrote a blog post that explained why Tesla was excluded from the index, that Twitter users started disseminating it, catching Musk's attention.

Only a tiny fraction of the ESG's industry's assets under management - $11.7 billion as of the end of 2020 - are tied to S&P Indexes. S&P's influential ESG index rival MSCI Inc (MSCI.N) has so far kept Tesla in its bluechip ESG index.

It was not immediately clear if the exclusion from the S&P ESG index had any impact on Tesla's shares this week. The stock had already been sliding almost every day since early April, losing close to 40% of its value, amid concerns that China's COVID-19-related lockdowns will disrupt Tesla's car production and a potential economic slowdown and raging inflation will dampen demand for its vehicles. read more

Uncertainty over whether Musk will complete his $44 billion acquisition of Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) has also weighed on Tesla's stock.

SCORE BREAKDOWN

S&P declined to provide a breakdown of its ESG score of Tesla, which is compiled based on scores of the company's various operations and practices.

MSCI also declined to provide a breakdown, but a May 3 copy of its Tesla rating sent to investors and reviewed by Reuters shows how its perceived poor performance on social issues took some of the shine out of the company's strong green credentials.

Tesla scored 9.1 out of 10 on environmental grounds, against an industry average of 6.5. This made up 30% of its total ESG score. On social issues, however, it ranked 1.4 compared with an average of 3.5, while on governance it scored 5.1 against an average of 3.2.

Andrew Poreda, senior vice president for Sage Advisory Services, an Austin-based investment firm, said as a Tesla investor he understood why the company's ESG scores were lower than they might have been based solely on the company's contribution in the fight against climate change.

""You can't live in a vacuum of just environmental or just social issues, they are all intertwined,"" Poreda said.

315,Bear market beckons as US stock slide deepens,2022-05-20 18:55:41,"
NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The stock market's brutal year neared a grim milestone as the S&P 500's slide on Friday threatened to leave it in a bear market for the first time since March 2020, fueled by worries over sky high inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve and future economic growth.

The benchmark S&P 500 index fell below 3837.248, a decline that on an intraday basis put it 20% from its Jan. 3 record closing high. Should that hold until Friday's close, it would confirm that the index is in a bear market – frequently defined as a drop of at least 20% from a closing high.

If history is any guide, a bear market would mean more pain could be in store for investors. The S&P 500 has fallen by an average of 32.7% in 13 bear markets since 1946, including a nearly 57% drop during the 2007-2009 bear market during the financial crisis, according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.


It has taken a little over a year on average for the index to reach its bottom during bear markets, and then roughly another two years to return to its prior high, according to CFRA. Of the 13 bear markets since 1946, the return to breakeven levels has varied, taking as little as three months to as long as 69 months.

Reuters Graphics

The S&P 500 surged some 114% from its March 2020 low as stocks benefited from emergency policies put in place to help stabilize the economy in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.

That decline went into reverse at the start of 2022 as the Fed grew far more hawkish and signaled it would tighten monetary policy at a faster-than-expected clip to fight surging inflation. It has already raised rates by 75 basis points this year and expectations of more hikes ahead have weighed on stocks and bonds.

Fed Chairman Jerome Powell has vowed to raise rates as high as needed to kill inflation but also believes policymakers can guide the economy to a so-called soft landing. read more

Adding to the volatility has been the war in Ukraine, which has caused a further spike in oil and other commodity prices.

A few areas of the stock market have been spared. Energy shares have soared this year, along with oil prices, while defensive groups such as utilities have held up better than broader markets.

On the flip side, shares of technology and other high-growth companies have been hit hard. Those stocks -- high fliers during much of the bull market over the past decade -- are particularly sensitive to higher yields, which dull the allure of companies whose cash flows are weighted more in the future and diminished when discounted at higher rates.

Some of the biggest of these companies, such as Tesla (TSLA.O) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms (FB.O), are also heavily weighted in the S&P 500 index.

Investors have looked at various metrics to determine when markets will turn higher, including the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street’s fear gauge. While the index is elevated compared to its long-term median, it is still below levels reached in previous major selloffs. read more

316,SP 500 tumbles on verge of confirming bear market,2022-05-20 18:43:15,"
Summary

Summary Companies Ross Stores plunges after cutting 2022 forecast

S&P 500 -1.97%, Nasdaq -2.61%, Dow -1.72%

May 20 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 tumbled on Friday, putting the widely followed benchmark on the verge of confirming it has been in a bear market since hitting a record high in January.

Worries about surging inflation and rising interest rates have pummeled the U.S. stock market this year, with danger signals from Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and other retailers this week adding to fears about the economy.

Wall Street opened stronger on Friday morning before turning sharply negative and adding to deep losses sustained earlier in the week.


""Any positivity is being sold in a very heavy and high-volume fashion, and that's very concerning,"" said Keith Buchanan, a portfolio manager at Globalt Investments. ""It feels like it's fear driven.""

The S&P 500 was on track to close down 19.4% from its Jan. 3 record high close. Closing down 20% from that record level would confirm it has been in a bear market since reaching that high, according to a common definition. That would be the S&P 500's second bear market since the 2020 global selloff caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

Earlier in Friday's session, the S&P 500 was down almost 21% from its January high.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq (.IXIC) was last down 29% from its record close in November 2021.

S&P 500 bear markets

Weighing heavily on the S&P 500, Tesla (TSLA.O) dropped 9.8% after Chief Executive Elon Musk denounced as ""utterly untrue"" claims in a news report that he sexually harassed a flight attendant on a private jet in 2016. read more

Other megacap stocks also fell, with Apple down 2.7% and Google-owner Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O) losing 3.7%.

Ten of the 11 major S&P sectors declined, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and industrials (.SPLRCI) down 3.5% and 2.4%, respectively.

Shares of Deere & Co (DE.N) tumbled about 14% after the heavy equipment maker posted downbeat quarterly revenue. read more

Recent disappointing forecasts from big retailers Walmart, Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) and Target Inc (TGT.N) have rattled market sentiment, adding to evidence that rising prices have started to hurt the purchasing power of U.S. consumers.

On Friday, Ross Stores (ROST.O) plunged over 20% after the discount apparel retailer cut its 2022 forecasts for sales and profit, while Vans brand owner VF Corp (VFC.N) gained 3.9% on strong 2023 revenue outlook.

The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq are set for their seventh straight week of losses, their longest losing streak since the end of the dotcom bubble in 2001.

The Dow (.DJI) is on track for its eighth consecutive weekly decline, its longest since 1932 during the Great Depression.

Traders are pricing in 50-basis point rate hikes by the U.S. central bank in June and July.

In afternoon trading, the S&P 500 was down 1.97% at 3,823.92 points.

The Nasdaq declined 2.61% to 11,091.22 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 1.72% at 30,714.43 points.

S&P 500's busiest trades

Expiration of monthly options contracts on Friday was likely to boost trading volumes and could also add to volatility, especially toward the end of the session.

About two thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 3.00-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.61-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted 1 new 52-week highs and 48 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 10 new highs and 325 new lows.

COMMENTS:

PETER TUZ, PRESIDENT, CHASE INVESTMENT COUNSEL, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VIRGINIA

""Is it the last of it? What did Winston Churchill say about World War II? It’s probably the end of the beginning of the bear market, not the end of the bear market by itself.""

“How long it lasts will depend on when inflation breaks. The bear market will break at the same time or maybe slightly ahead of that. We have some Fed rate hikes over the next couple of months to contend with, some inflation data too. Then things will turn around.""

“What really flummoxed investors this week, myself included, is when you have the types of companies that typically do well in economic softness, do terribly, both as stocks and as companies. I'm thinking of Walmart and Target, and a few of the other companies of that ilk. These are the safe havens you run to in times of recession.""

“If the consumer is feeling bad and makes up 70% of the economy, you just have to watch out for the next few quarters.”

TOM MARTIN, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, GLOBALT INVESTMENTS, ATLANTA

“The most important time in the market is typically the last hour of trading. I'd rather say that if we continue to close down in that last hour, that probably doesn't bode well. But if we get a rally in the last hour with buyers stepping in, that does give some hope.”

“The market is cumulatively absorbing the information over the last week or so, particularly with the retail earnings that we've seen which has resulted in many of those stocks getting hammered.""

“Certainly, the sentiment among consumers is pretty negative. And when you relate that to investor positioning in the market, there's been a fair amount of money with exposure to the markets that we'd like to have less and hedge funds are reducing their overall exposure. They are selling what they can, they're having to cover their shorts, but clearly, the selling of longs is overwhelming any short covering.""

“So as people adjust to this, they are looking for where that bottom is, and, you know, the consensus seems to have been prior to today that we weren't there yet. Now, whether this takes us there, down to that market level of support that might be at least a temporary bottom before we could get some sort of balance is an open question. And, you know, people looking to things like the VIX which although up today is still below levels that have in the past been associated with market bottoms.”

“As bad as the markets are reacting, they haven't reacted to the extent on average that they've reacted to recessionary environments before. So there's more to go if we are indeed going to go into a recession and have an average market decline associated with that. A lot of that is going to depend on the actual path of inflation, and on what the Federal Reserve does, among other things like the war in Ukraine and the COVID policy in China etc. So there remains a high level of uncertainty. And you just don't know whether we've reached enough of a bottom that there'll be a counter trend rally.”

BRIAN JACOBSEN, SENIOR INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, ALLSPRING GLOBAL INVESTMENTS, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN

“We have to see if we close at these levels or not, but investors are clearly afraid of a recession. Corrections are driven by fears of inflation, recession, and geopolitics. We have the trifecta going on right now. Whether we stay at these levels or go lower depends on whether the fears become reality. The reports from major retailers increase the perceived odds of a recession being realized soon, but I’m not convinced that they’re bellwethers. A little more stimulus from China or maybe a more stable inflation print on Friday from the PCE price index could help provide a floor.”

KIM FORREST, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BOKEH CAPITAL PARTNERS, PITTSBURGH

""It's a watermark but it's relatively meaningless. Can it go lower? Yes of course.""

""Hitting this mark, maintaining it and not going lower might give investors the confidence to buy.""

""Investors are all about the worst case scenario ... so all these geopolitical things could push us lower. That being said today China rate cut gave us a positive open. It is something that, if you're a longer term investor, you need to pay attention to. This is because China's rate cut might make the Fed less aggressive out to concern for a too strong dollar.""

""A higher interest rate environment calls for lower multiples. That's what we've been doing is decreasing the multiple on stocks ... if that pressure alleviates we could get back in the business of looking at businesses.""

PAUL NOLTE, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, KINGSVIEW INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, CHICAGO

""If we don't today it'll be Monday. In all of the trading that's gone on in the last couple of weeks, there really hasn't been much of a bounce. Any bounce we've had has gone away quickly. So we're going to be in a bear market today if not next week. It's more inevitable than it is anything else. It's a given, certainly with what's happened to Nasdaq and small caps. It's not a surprise that the S&P finally gets there.

""I don't think investors sell because we're now in a bear market. They've been selling all along. The question is still what does the Fed do. They have historically come to the market's rescue. We're not sure where the Powell put is this time around - or if there is one... Although they've raised rates twice, we really haven't seen any impact in the economy outside of housing.""

RANDY FREDERICK, VICE PRESIDENT OF TRADING AND DERIVATIVES, CHARLES SCHWAB, AUSTIN, TEXAS

""It does look like we are finally going to actually hit a bear market on the S&P 500 which to me is the final straw that says you are truly in a bear market, you have to close below 3,836, which we are below that level now. Now we could get one of those late-day rallies like we sometimes get so it may not happen.""

""But the one thing that doesn’t really seem to line up as far as the washout goes, or the capitulation, is just with the VIX. Thirty-two is not a low VIX, historically it is high, but it is not at all in line with what you oftentimes see when everybody throws in the towel, I am selling indiscriminately, I’m fed up, I am just trying to save what I got left kind of thinking. We just haven’t seen that.""

""Generally, you are going to need to see something above forty and sometimes it is even way above that. If you go back to the COVID bear market in early 2020 it hit like eighty so it is nothing even close to that. I believe we are going to go into a bear market, whether that happens today or early next week I am not sure, but I am not convinced we are at the bottom yet simply because of that.""

""Now it is not required you have one of those days but you oftentimes do, we could just simply go into a continued, slow, downtrend which frankly we have been in since the second day of this year. While that doesn’t hurt as much all at once, it is like pulling the band-aid off slowly, it is going to be long and slow and painful and frankly could go on for several more months so I just don’t know. But without that big, giant volatility spike and that capitulation-type feeling I am hesitant to make any predictions that we are at the bottom.""

318,Wall St Week Ahead As bear market looms battered Wall St seeks elusive Fed put,2022-05-20 17:54:41,"
NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's determination to raise interest rates until it squashes the highest inflation in decades is darkening the outlook across Wall Street, as U.S. stocks stand on the cusp of a bear market and warnings of a recession grow louder.

At issue is the so-called Fed put, or investors’ belief that the Fed will take action if stocks fall too deeply, even though it has no mandate to maintain asset prices. One oft-cited example of the phenomenon, which is named after a hedging derivative used to protect against market falls, occurred when the Fed halted a rate hiking cycle in early 2019 after a stock market tantrum.

This time around, the Fed’s insistence that it will raise rates as high as needed to tame surging inflation has bolstered the argument that policymakers will be less sensitive to market volatility - threatening more pain for investors. read more


A recent survey by BofA Global Research showed fund managers now expect the Fed to step in at 3,529 on the S&P 500 (.SPX), compared with expectations of 3,700 in February. Such a drop would constitute a 26% decline from the S&P’s Jan. 3 closing high.

The index, which was recently at 3,840, is already down around 20% from that high this year on an intraday basis - putting it on track to confirm a bear market, according to some definitions.

""The Fed has bigger fish to fry and that's the inflation problem,"" said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist at Federated Hermes, who is increasing his cash levels. ""The 'Fed put' is kaput until the central bank is confident that they're no longer behind the curve.""

As a result, some investors are digging in for a long slog. BofA’s survey showed cash allocations at a two-decade high, while bets against technology stocks stand at their highest since 2006.

Strategists at Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, earlier this week published a “Recession manual for US equities” in response to client inquiries on how stocks will perform in a downturn. Barclays analysts said that numerous negative near-term catalysts mean the risks for stocks “remain firmly stacked to the downside."" read more

The S&P 500 was recently down 1.5% on Friday, on track for its seventh straight week of losses.

Jason England, global bonds portfolio manager at Janus Henderson Investors, believes the index needs to fall at least another 15% for the Fed to slow its tightening, given that unprecedented monetary policy support helped stocks more than double from their March 2020 lows.

""The Fed is being very clear that there will be some pain ahead,"" he said.

The Fed has already raised rates by 75 basis points and is expected to tighten monetary policy by 193 basis points this year. /FEDWATCH Investors will get more insight into the central bank's thinking when minutes from its last meeting are released on May 25.

2018 REDUX?

Some worry the Fed risks exacerbating volatility if it does not heed possible danger signs from asset prices. Analysts at the Institute of International Finance said stocks may be subject to the same type of selling that rocked markets in late 2018, when many investors believed the Fed tightened monetary policy too far.

“In the past, rising uncertainty and mounting recession risk have had important effects on investor psychology, making markets less tolerant of monetary policy tightening that is seen as no longer warranted,” IIF analysts wrote on Thursday. “The risk of a similar market tantrum (to 2018) is rising again now as markets fret about global recession.”

There have been signs of resilient sentiment among investors. For example, the Cboe Volatility Index (.VIX), known as Wall Street’s fear gauge, is elevated but below levels it reached during previous major selloffs. read more

And the ARK Innovation Fund ARKK.K, which became emblematic of the pandemic rally, has brought in net positive inflows of $977 million over the last six weeks, Lipper data showed. The fund is down 57% in 2022.

While some investors say those are signals that markets are yet to bottom, others are more hopeful. read more

Terri Spath, chief investment officer at Zuma Wealth, believes some investors are re-entering parts of the stock market that have suffered outsized losses.

""The Fed is already seeing signs that they won't be needed as a buyer of last resort,"" she said.

Analysts at Deutsche Bank are less optimistic.

""The Fed having badly erred on the side of excess inflation in 2020/21, cannot afford to make the same mistake twice - which favors more financial conditions tightening, and ongoing high (volatility) panicky markets,"" they wrote.

319,Retail selloff discounters auto stores lead losses,2022-05-20 17:10:23,"
May 20 (Reuters) - A rout in consumer stocks gained more steam on Friday, as shares of Ross Stores (ROST.O) led a retreat of other discount stores to cap off a bleak week for retailers.

Ross shares were down 24.4% at $70.06 after falling as low as $69.75 after the discount apparel retailer cut its 2022 same-store-sales estimate to a decline of 2%-4% versus an earlier flat-to-up 3% target.

Dollar General (DG.N), which is due to report earnings next week, lost 8.4% after falling 14% in the last three sessions. Dollar Tree (DLTR.O) fell 7.7%. T.J. Maxx parent co TJX Co (TJX.N) fell 8.2%.


Among auto retailers, Advance Auto Parts (AAP.N) was down 9.7% and Autozone (AZO.N) fell 9.1% with both expected to report quarterly results in the week ahead. Shares in rival O' Reilly Auto (ORLY.O) were down 5.8%.

While Walmart (WMT.N) and Target (TGT.N) earlier this week reported that store traffic was still strong, high inflation ate into their profits. With fuel and freight costs still rising and supply chains still disrupted Mona Mahajan, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, sees sector-wide repercussions.

""It's hard to see how some of these smaller retailers can withstand the margin pressures if some giants like Walmart and Target haven't been able to,"" she said.

But generally healthy balance sheets and retail sales data released earlier this week suggest healthy U.S. spending.

""In a recessionary environment you'd see consumers going towards those bargain brands for sure. But we haven't yet seen that,"" Mahajan said.

The S&P 500 Consumer discretionary sector (.SPLRCD) was down 3.7% after hitting its lowest point since July 2020, on track for a weekly decline of more than 9%, its seventh in a row and its biggest weekly loss since March 2020.

Target was down 1.1%, tracking a roughly 31% weekly loss. Walmart falling 1.0%, was eying a 20% weekly drop.

Macys (M.N) was down 9.5% and Kohl's (M.N), was down 13.4% and about 19% for the week after its results also disappointed.

U.S. Treasury yields fell for a third straight session on concerns about growth prospects. The yield on benchmark 10-year notes fell 5.6 basis points to 2.799%.

Equity valuations need to come down and the expected return on investments, the discount rate, needs to go up, said Stephen Auth, chief investment officer of equities at Federated Hermes.

""The market is starting to digest the idea that this might be a new world where the discount rate on risk assets is not zero anymore,"" Auth said.

""You're seeing all these different areas of the market get pounded at the same time and it's just been very unsettling for investors,"" he added.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) fell 1.09%, the S&P 500 (.SPX) lost 1.28% and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) dropped 1.83%.

Fed funds futures were firmer, suggesting that the U.S. rate market has pulled back a bit from some of its more extreme rate hike estimates. The rates market has priced in a fed funds rate of 2.783% at the end of next year, compared with a current level of 0.83%. The rate was as high as 2.9% two weeks ago.

The dollar recouped some of its recent losses against the euro but remained on pace for its worst weekly loss against the common currency since early February as investors questioned whether the greenback's month-long rally was done.

Richemont cautious on China growth

May 20 (Reuters) - European shares rose on Friday, with a boost from defensive sectors after hopes of an economic recovery in major trading partner China were bolstered by more central bank stimulus, though they still ended the week in the red.

China's central bank cut its five-year loan prime rate by a larger-than-expected 15 basis points (bps), boosting global market sentiment even as COVID-19 cases in Shanghai climbed again. read more

Travel and tourism stocks (.SXTP), financial services (.SXFP), healthcare (.SXDP) and utilities (.SX6P) led gains in Europe, rising between 1.5% and 2.0%, lifting the pan-European STOXX 600 index (.STOXX) 0.7%.


Over the week, though, the main index was down 0.5%.

""It is not surprising perhaps that we have a little bit of a bounce today given the good news from China overnight and as we have had some very negative days this week,"" said Jonathan Bell, chief investment officer at Stanhope Capital.

Global stock markets saw another volatile week as recession fears gripped investors after weak Chinese retail sales data and dismal results from big U.S. retailers highlighted the impact from surging inflation.

Over the week, European retail (.SXRP) and food and beverage stocks (.SX3P) lost 2.2% and about 5%, respectively, while miners (.SXPP) outperformed, rising 4.4%.

Data on Friday showed British retail sales jumped unexpectedly in April, but the outlook for consumer spending remained resolutely downbeat. read more

Separate data showed a record rise in German producer prices last month, as the Ukraine war pushed up energy costs.

Euro zone money markets ramped up their bets on a 50-bp interest rate hike from the European Central Bank in July that would bring the bank's policy rate to 0%. read more

""We think these price pressures will continue to build in the coming months,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics.

""That in turn informs our view that the ECB will want to move rapidly to tighten policy. We are forecasting a 25 bp rate hike in July, but as we argue here, there is a growing chance that the ECB kicks off with a 50 bp hike.""

322,Canada finance minister defends Bank of Canada amid opposition attacks,2022-05-20 15:41:27,"
OTTAWA, May 20 (Reuters) - Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland on Friday defended the central bank as inflation spikes to a three-decade high and the frontrunner to take over the opposition Conservative Party pledges to fire the Bank of Canada governor if elected.

""It is clear to us all that we are living through a period of global volatility. We have COVID. We have the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We have China's zero-COVID policy,"" Freeland told reporters by teleconference from Munich, Germany after a G7 meeting.

""In this environment, responsible political leadership means reinforcing for Canadians, and for the world, our government's very clear commitment to the independence of the Bank of Canada and our confidence in the Bank of Canada.""


Pierre Poilievre, who leads in all polls ahead of a September vote to elect a new Conservative leader, has said he would turf Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem ""to get inflation under control"" if he becomes prime minister.

Inflation inched up to 6.8% in April, with food price growth hitting a four decade high, upping the pressure on the central bank to hike interest rates quickly to avoid an inflationary spiral. read more

Separately, Canada said on Friday it was imposing additional sanctions on Russian oligarchs and banning trade in certain luxury goods with Russia in response to Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. read more

Freeland also told reporters the G7 had broadly discussed ""further strengthening"" sanctions against Russia, including the question of an oil and gas embargo.

""We absolutely recognize that the economic challenge of an oil and gas embargo is much greater for our European partners,"" she said, adding the group had discussed ways Canada could support Europe on energy security.

Annual core inflation, which strips out some volatile food and energy items, was seen at 7.22%, down slightly from 7.27% in the previous two weeks. (MXCPIC=ECI)

324,Dollar selling takes a pause after bruising week,2022-05-20 14:55:05,"
NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar recouped some of its losses against the euro on Friday, but remained set for its worst weekly performance against the common currency since early February as investors questioned whether the greenback's month-long rally was done.

The greenback has been supported in recent months by a flight to safety by investors, amid a rout across markets due to fears of the impact of soaring inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

That rally, however, sputtered this week as increased volatility in global financial markets sent investors to the yen and the Swiss franc for safety.


The dollar was up about 0.3% against the euro. For the week the U.S. currency was down about 1.5%, its worst weekly showing against the euro since early February.

""The buck struggled to keep afloat this week as the rush to safety resulted in higher U.S. Treasury bond prices and lower yields,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington, D.C.

""Meanwhile, an improving timeframe and trajectory for ECB interest rate hikes gave the euro an added boost,"" Manimbo said.

Euro zone money markets on Friday ramped up their bets on a 50 basis-point interest rate hike from the European Central Bank in July that would bring the bank's policy rate to 0%.

Earlier this week, Dutch central bank governor and ECB policymaker Klaas Knot said the bank should keep the door open to a 50 bps hike if upcoming data suggested inflation was ""broadening further or accumulating"". read more

The dollar's retreat this week came after it hit a more than 5-year high against the euro last week.

""We see the buck as a bit elevated for sure and see room for other currencies to flourish as there is a gradual shift to better prospects if the global economy is to be helped out and revived from a terrible first half to the year,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA in Washington.

Other safe-haven currencies have rallied this week as global equities have come under pressure, although stocks in Europe clawed back some ground on Friday. read more

The Swiss franc was on track for a near 3% weekly gain versus the dollar, its best weekly gain in more than two years, while the Japanese yen was set for an almost 1% weekly gain.

Sterling, up 0.06% on Friday, was set for its biggest weekly gain since December 2020 against the dollar as the latest economic data suggested the market might not need to scale back its expectations for Bank of England rate hikes much further. read more

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was about flat at just above $30,000, arresting steep declines seen in recent weeks.

325,Junk bonds are showing signs of liquidity strains as the SampP 500 heads into bear market territory,2022-05-20 15:17:00,"Concerns about the U.S. economy slipping into a recession isn’t the only thing nagging at corporate bond investors.

Trading in the riskier high-yield, or “junk-bond,” segment of corporate debt also has become a lot trickier in recent weeks, including as investors flee bond funds and the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.57% teeters on officially entering another bear market.

Read: The S&P 500 is trading in bear-market territory. How far could it fall?

With trading activity serving as a key engine of functioning financial markets, big intraday gaps, in terms of where investors are willing to buy or sell bonds, can matter a lot, particularly as fears rise and liquidity drains from markets.

“Extreme risk aversion, defensive positioning, poor sentiment and funding concerns” all are gripping the U.S. high-yield bond market, said Oleg Melentyev’s strategy team at BofA Global, in a Friday client note.

Unlike transparency in stocks trading on exchanges, a huge swath of the U.S. bond market still trades with delayed transparency, making sentiment hard to gauge in real time.

To that end, Goldman Sachs analysts analyzed the divergence between where buyers and sellers have been willing to transact (see chart) in the U.S. junk-bond market over time. They found recent high-low intraday swings, or the “bid-ask spread,” nearing levels last seen amid in the wake of the March 2020 pandemic panic, in a weekly client note.

Liquidity pinch? Intraday volatility is picking up in junk bonds TRACE, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research

The Goldman team, led by Lotfi Karoui, pointed to a “notable uptick in intraday volatility, across the board,” including for the large iShares iBoxx $ High Yield Corporate Bond ETF, HYG, +0.01% where the high-low intraday range “suggests a higher hurdle for investors to deploy capital.”

Corporate bonds, from a total return perspective, have been deeply negative this year as the Federal Reserve works to fight high inflation by raising interest rates and cutting the size of its record $9 trillion balance sheet.

Until May, most of the negative performance was attributed to rates volatility, with the 10-year Treasury rate TMUBMUSD10Y, 2.784% topping 3.2% earlier this month, nearing a peak level last seen in 2018, or before the 2020 pandemic recession hit.

Bond yields and prices move in the opposite directions, sinking many longer dated corporate bonds by major U.S. companies to $70 prices, and lower, from around $100 to start the year.

What’s more, the Goldman team tracked $87 billion in notional U.S. high-yield bonds as trading at distressed levels, or a spread of at least 1,000 basis points above the risk-free Treasury rate, up from $24 billion as of July 2021, a post-financial crisis low for spreads in the sector.

On the recession-watch front, a key index for riskier CCC rated junk bonds and below crossed into distressed territory this week, last pegged at a spread of 1,061 basis points above Treasurys.

326,Why the looming bear market will be different,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business' Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here . You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link.

London (CNN Business) When a bear market arrives, it's not pretty, especially for investors making short-term decisions. But it happens — and a recovery arrives eventually.

Quick refresher: A ""bear market"" refers to when stocks drop 20% or more from their recent peak. They're a sign of extreme negative sentiment on Wall Street and are more severe than garden-variety sell-offs.

Since World War II, the S&P 500 has experienced 17 bear markets or near bear markets, according to an analysis by LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick. Number 18 is all but certain to arrive soon.

The S&P 500 is down 18.7% from its high in early January, battered by concerns about inflation, interest rate hikes and the war in Ukraine. Most traders don't expect it to begin staging a sustained comeback for some time.

""The sour mood has been persistent,"" Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at Bleakley Advisory Group, wrote to clients earlier this week.

Historically, when the S&P 500 has entered a bear market, the average drop was almost 30% and went on for nearly a year.

That period is painful, but it doesn't last forever. And importantly, bear markets haven't always been precursors to recessions in the United States.

""In 1987, we had a bear market and no recession, and earnings continued to rise,"" Edward Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research, told me. ""That may very well turn out to be the environment we're in now.""

Still, economists and investors acknowledge that the risk of a recession will rise as inflation eats into consumer spending and the Federal Reserve keeps hiking rates in a bid to combat the problem.

""The probabilities have been growing all year long,"" said Darrell Cronk, president of the Wells Fargo Investment Institute. His team now believes it's more likely than not that the United States economy shrinks later this year and in early 2023, he added.

What happens next? It's easy for every bear market to seem like the end of the world, as nervous traders anxiously eye a sea of red. But to date, every huge bust has been followed by an even bigger rally. It's just a question of when the recovery begins.

This time around, that timing is much harder to predict. Usually, a bear market bottoms out when the Fed decides its work is done and eases policy. But with inflation rising at the fastest clip in decades, the central bank has signaled that it intends to remain hawkish for some time.

""For the sake of its credibility, it has to stay the course here in terms of bringing inflation down,"" Yardeni said.

In addition to raising rates, the Fed will soon begin the process of selling the bonds it bought in recent years, another mechanism for stimulating the economy. It's never done that for very long before, which makes it harder to discern what the market response will be.

""The only time they've really done that with intent was the end of 2018 and they abruptly and quickly stopped that as growth rolled over in early 2019,"" Cronk said.

That makes it difficult to find a helpful precedent for the bear market on tap.

""There's not a lot of good models to use,"" he continued.

China is flooding its struggling economy with support

China took major steps on Friday to rescue its slumping housing market and head off a major downturn in the world's second largest economy.

The People's Bank of China cut its five-year loan prime rate — a key interest rate — by 15 basis points to 4.45%, the second reduction this year and the largest on record. Most analysts had expected a cut of five basis points, my CNN Business colleague Laura He reports.

China's so-called ""LPR"" is the rate at which commercial banks lend to their best customers. It serves as the benchmark for other loans and the five-year maturity is typically used as a reference for mortgages.

The central bank's decision to slash the five-year rate is the latest in a series of steps that China has taken to tackle a real estate crisis as Covid lockdowns threaten to push the economy into its first quarterly contraction since early 2020.

Sales of new homes plunged 47% in April from a year earlier, the National Bureau of Statistics said earlier this week, while prices in 70 cities dropped for an eighth consecutive month.

Zhaopeng Xing, senior China strategist for ANZ Research, called the move a signal that leadership wants to backstop the struggling housing sector ""as soon as possible.""

""It also suggests that China is making great efforts to achieve its 5.5% growth target"" for 2022, he added.

Step back: The Chinese economy could shrink in the second quarter as Covid lockdowns weigh heavily on output. Consumer spending and factory production both shrank sharply last month, while unemployment surged to the highest level since the initial coronavirus outbreak in early 2020.

The property sector, which accounts for as much as 30% of China's GDP, also faces a deepening crisis.

Evergrande — one of the country's biggest developers — is undergoing a huge restructuring after it defaulted on its massive debts late last year. Analysts have long feared Evergrande's collapse could ripple across the property industry.

People are just buying sweets and booze

In the United Kingdom, inflation is at its highest level since 1982 and growth is at a standstill — a toxic economic cocktail.

But there's some good news: Brits are still shopping.

The bad news? They're spending their money on alcohol, sweets and tobacco, a sign that people are spending more time at home as their expenses rise or seeking out small, inexpensive pleasures.

Breaking it down: UK retail sales unexpectedly rose in April, the government said in data released Friday. Inflation hit a 40-year high of 9% the same month.

But dig into the data, and it's way less rosy. Yes, sales at food stores picked up — but that was driven by purchases of booze, cigarettes and treats. It's hard to argue stress eating and other indulgences reveal that consumers are thriving.

""Don't be fooled by the rebound in retail sales in April,"" Niraj Shah of Bloomberg Economics said . ""The biggest squeeze on incomes in a generation is set to further constrain consumer spending in the coming months.""

Investor insight: Concerns about the UK economy have caused the pound to collapse. The currency is down almost 8% against the US dollar year-to-date.

327,Dollar selling takes a pause after bruising week,2022-05-20 14:53:43,"
NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. dollar recouped some of its losses against the euro on Friday, but remained set for its worst weekly performance against the common currency since early February as investors questioned whether the greenback's month-long rally was done.

The greenback has been supported in recent months by a flight to safety by investors, amid a rout across markets due to fears of the impact of soaring inflation, a hawkish Federal Reserve and the Russia-Ukraine conflict.

That rally, however, sputtered this week as increased volatility in global financial markets sent investors to the yen and the Swiss franc for safety.


The dollar was up about 0.3% against the euro. For the week the U.S. currency was down about 1.5%, its worst weekly showing against the euro since early February.

""The buck struggled to keep afloat this week as the rush to safety resulted in higher U.S. Treasury bond prices and lower yields,"" said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington, D.C.

""Meanwhile, an improving timeframe and trajectory for ECB interest rate hikes gave the euro an added boost,"" Manimbo said.

Euro zone money markets on Friday ramped up their bets on a 50 basis-point interest rate hike from the European Central Bank in July that would bring the bank's policy rate to 0%.

Earlier this week, Dutch central bank governor and ECB policymaker Klaas Knot said the bank should keep the door open to a 50 bps hike if upcoming data suggested inflation was ""broadening further or accumulating"". read more

The dollar's retreat this week came after it hit a more than 5-year high against the euro last week.

""We see the buck as a bit elevated for sure and see room for other currencies to flourish as there is a gradual shift to better prospects if the global economy is to be helped out and revived from a terrible first half to the year,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA in Washington.

Other safe-haven currencies have rallied this week as global equities have come under pressure, although stocks in Europe clawed back some ground on Friday. read more

The Swiss franc was on track for a near 3% weekly gain versus the dollar, its best weekly gain in more than two years, while the Japanese yen was set for an almost 1% weekly gain.

Sterling, up 0.06% on Friday, was set for its biggest weekly gain since December 2020 against the dollar as the latest economic data suggested the market might not need to scale back its expectations for Bank of England rate hikes much further. read more

In cryptocurrencies, bitcoin was about flat at just above $30,000, arresting steep declines seen in recent weeks.

328,Growth scare permeates US stocks as estimated 5 trillion to 8 trillion of household wealth evaporates in five months,2022-05-20 15:08:00,"Amid a sea of red in U.S. stock markets on Friday, a fundamental shift in investors’ thinking is taking place, one which analysts describe as a “growth scare.”



A “growth scare” is characterized by a correction in anticipation of slowing economic growth, even if such a slowdown hasn’t yet been borne out by the data. Dow industrials DJIA, -0.49% are poised for their longest streak of weekly losses in 90 years and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.60% appeared to be on track to close in bear-market territory, as investors flocked to Treasurys and the dollar as safe havens of choice.

See: The S&P 500 is trading in bear-market territory. How far could it fall?



Friday’s broad-based selloff in equities punished every industry and every stock strategy —- from value and small-cap to growth, as well as the consumer-discretionary, energy, utilities, financial and tech sectors. Economists at JPMorgan Chase & Co. JPM, -1.71% estimate that U.S. household wealth has fallen by $5 trillion to $8 trillion in 2022, driven largely by falling equity prices. And BofA Securities strategists ranked U.S. equities as this year’s worst-performing asset class, as well as the third-biggest loser among global stocks ahead of only Chinese and German equities, based on data through Wednesday.



Prior rounds of U.S. stock selloffs this year were largely driven by prospects of rising interest rates from the Federal Reserve, which is attempting to stomp out the highest inflation in four decades. While the risks of a recession or economic slowdown lingered in the backdrop, they hadn’t been brought to the fore. Many in financial markets have remained confident the U.S. can avoid a downturn, or speak of recession risks in terms of the next one to two years.



Data released in April shows the U.S. economy shrank 1.4% during the first quarter, mainly because of a record U.S. trade deficit, following a 6.9% surge in GDP in the final three months of 2021. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines a recession as a significant decline in activity lasting more than a few months.



But deteriorating stock values and financial conditions may have the potential to hasten the anticipated arrival of an economic downturn, according to some traders.



“For a good portion of this year, we saw a positive correlation between equities and bonds: that is, a selloff in equities and selloff on bonds,” said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Société Générale. “Now, we’re seeing a rally in bonds correspond to a selloff in equities. The subtle shift is that bonds are starting to act as safe haven, suggesting a growth scare and the potential for demand destruction that leads to lower growth.’’



“Clearly, this week’s price action in stocks stems from earnings guidance and forward-looking guidance on consumer spending, signaling the potential for a retrenchment,’’ she said via phone. Still, Rajappa said she isn’t seeing any “concrete evidence” of a recession in the data, though some slowdown in growth can’t be ruled out. She also foresees no serious risk of recession in the next 12 months.



As of Friday, there have been 59 negative earnings-per-share preannouncements issued by S&P 500 companies for the second quarter, and 32 that were positive, according to Refinitiv’s S&P 500 Earnings Scorecard. That compares with 55 that were negative and 28 which were positive a week ago.



Read: S&P 500 earnings are another potential `shock’ awaiting financial markets trying to shake off stagflation fears: economist



Meanwhile, the flight to safety in government bonds was felt most acutely in the longest-term maturities, sending 10- TMUBMUSD10Y, 2.785% and 30-year rates TMUBMUSD30Y, 3.000% below 2.8% and 3% respectively. Yields drop when demand for bonds goes up.



The price action in bonds led to shrinking spreads between the 2-year TMUBMUSD02Y, 2.578% and 10-year rates, as well as between 5-year TMUBMUSD05Y, 2.806% and 30-year rates, which are seen as worrisome signs about the outlook. In addition, the 5-year rate traded above the 10-year yield, inverting that part of the curve.



Meanwhile, the ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.35% rose 0.5% to 103.24, not far from some of the highest levels in almost 20 years.



Over the past two years, since the pandemic began, U.S. household wealth has increased by $30 trillion, Michael Feroli, JPMorgan’s chief U.S. economist, said via phone Friday. In a sense, the market is “giving back a little bit from a period of strong gains and households are generally still probably sitting on unrealized gains over the past year,” he said.



JPMorgan isn’t yet forecasting a recession and expects U.S. growth to remain positive through next year, Feroli said. “But the risks are pretty elevated and over the next two years it’s a coin flip as to whether we go into a recession.”

329,Rowe to exit MS with jump in profit but much still to do,2022-05-20 13:15:45,"
Summary

Summary Companies Steve Rowe steps down as CEO on Wednesday

Food boss Stuart Machin starts as new CEO

M&S to report jump in 2021-22 profit

With grim consumer backdrop cautious outlook expected

LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - Steve Rowe will next week step down as chief executive of British retailer Marks & Spencer (MKS.L) after a turbulent six years in the top job, with his internal successor set for a baptism of fire amid a worsening cost-of-living crisis.

Rowe, who joined M&S at the age of 15 before rising through the ranks, will end a 39-year career at the clothing and food group after presenting annual results on Wednesday that are expected to show a jump in profit.

Along with chairman Archie Norman, Rowe has sought to transform the 138-year old M&S with a radical overhaul of its store estate, a renewed focus on the quality and value of its clothing and food, and heavy investment in technology and e-commerce, including a joint venture with Ocado (OCDO.L) that belatedly took M&S food online.


Having steered M&S through the COVID-19 pandemic, he exits with hopes raised that one of Britain's most elusive turnarounds could finally materialise after two decades of false dawns.

But he also departs with M&S's share price at well below half the level it was when he became CEO in 2016 and with UK consumers facing the biggest squeeze on disposable income since at least the 1950s. read more

Rowe will be succeeded by food boss and joint chief operating officer Stuart Machin, who will become chief executive and take on responsibility for day-to-day leadership of the business and its executive committee. read more

An unconventional structure will see him backed up by Katie Bickerstaffe, currently M&S's other chief operating officer, who will become co-chief executive, and finance and strategy chief Eoin Tonge.

Machin's first task will be to navigate Britain's cost-of-living crunch.

""While the typical clothing & home M&S customer is less exposed to mortgages, they will no doubt be feeling the pinch, while the food business is at risk of (shoppers) trading down over the coming months,"" said Santander analyst Rebecca McClellan. read more

With M&S having already flagged headwinds it is facing in the 2022-23 year, including labour, energy, fuel and logistics inflation, analysts expect a cautious outlook statement.

Last month, rivals Tesco and Sainsbury's both warned of lower profit this year. read more

Norman said this week that Britons were still spending despite inflation hitting a 40-year high. Official data also showed an unexpected jump in April sales. read more

""The crunch is going to be in the autumn when people come back from their holidays, they've spent their money and there's nothing left in the kitty,"" Norman told BBC radio.

For the year to April 2, M&S is expected to report profit before tax and adjusting items of 522 million pounds ($651 million), according to analysts' average forecast. It made just 41.6 million pounds in the pandemic hit 2020-21 year.

Total clothing and home UK sales are seen up 46.6% on 2020-21 and up 0.5% on 2019-20, while food sales are seen up 10.3% on 2020-21 and 9.7% on 2019-20.

No dividend is expected.

330,Robinhood investors are going to get their heads handed to them as bear market takes hold says Godfather of chart analysis,2022-05-20 14:56:00,"A bear market for the S&P 500? The stage certainly appears to be set for one, as equity benchmarks added to ugly weekly declines on Friday.

Prominent market technician Ralph Acampora told MarketWatch that stocks may still be looking at “another 10% or 15% to come on the downside,” as a protracted period of lofty valuations comes unbound.

“I think there’s so much confusion out there,” Acampora, a pioneer in the field of chart-based trading, told MarketWatch, in an interview on Friday afternoon. He speculated that the point of capitulation for most investors still hadn’t been achieved in stocks, based on his analysis.

“I think it could come in the next couple of months, though,” he said. The market technician said he wanted to see a more pronounced move in the Cboe Volatility Index VIX, +3.10% , aka VIX, with, perhaps, a one-day jump of around 50% seen as a meaningfully indicator, in his view.

The VIX itself, which uses S&P 500 options to measure trader expectations for volatility over the coming 30-day period, stood at around 32 on Friday. The index tends to rise as stocks fall and is often therefore referred to as a guide to the level of investor fear. Its historical average ranges between 19 and 20 and it was up 10% so far this week and 84% in the year to date.

Check out: How long does the average bear market last? Selloff leaves Dow, S&P 500 near threshold.

Stocks, meanwhile, have been convulsing lower.

Friday’s slump comes after the indexes opened higher on the session and after the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.50% and S&P 500 booked their lowest closes since March 2021 on Thursday, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Acampora sees the current environment, with the Federal Reserve raising rates in the face of a surge in inflation, as leading to the end of the long-term bullish phase of stocks, with retail investors crowding into popular technology and meme-related trades.

“I think the Robinhoods, they’re going to get their heads handed to them,” said Acampora.

“And that will be a good lesson to them in investing,” he said, referring to trading platform Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD, -2.40% , popular among a younger set of retail investors.

Indeed, the S&P 500 has been on the precipice of a decline into bear-market territory, with a close below 3,837.25 marking the 20% pullback from the benchmark’s recent high, which would meet the widely accepted criteria for a bear market.

The Dow, meanwhile, was 16.5% below its Jan. 4 record finish, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.06% was already in bear-market territory and extended its tumble.

It isn’t all gloom for Acampora, he says that after markets eventually “wash out,” and the remaining bulls throw in their towels, he is anticipating that a rebound will take hold.

“It’s not the end of the world,” he said.

One factor that gives the analyst pause in his timing is the growing number of bears, which he says could be contraindicative, suggesting the possibility of a burst higher sooner for stocks.

“Everybody’s negative and I don’t like being a part of the crowd,” he said. “But sometimes the crowds are right.”

332,SP 500 drops into bear market territory as recession fears mount,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business)The S&P 500 fell into bear market territory Friday, slipping more than 20% from its record high and potentially ending the bull run that began in March 2020. 
The designation comes on the heels of six straight weekly losses for the index and follows months of precipitous market drops. The S&P 500 has long been considered the most accurate measure of the nation's stock performance.  
In the three years prior to this bear market, the index grew by 90%.
Downward momentum pushed the S&P 500 further in afternoon trading, down more than 2% for the day and 20.3% from its record-high close of 4,796.46 in early January. 
The index's slide highlights investors' increasingly dark economic outlook—one fueled by slowing economic and earnings growth, rising inflation and the Federal Reserve's subsequent monetary tightening. 
These conditions will likely continue until there's enough economic data to prove that inflation is cooling, said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. ""I don't think we're at quite peak freakout yet,"" she said. ""It might not be enough just to cross over into bear territory."" 
Young sees a slow burn ahead. ""I think we might have to stay [in a bear market] for a little while. I don't know that we're going to bounce back out of it very quickly.""
Friday's drop is also a bad omen for the economy as a whole. Only one bear market in the last 50 years, the market crash of 1987, was not accompanied by a recession. 
""For the majority of the bull market since the March 2020 low, investors have had reasons to buy the dips; and given this slowdown is looking more 'natural' and protracted, there is a heightened degree of fear and not knowing where to hide,"" wrote Charles Schwab analyst Kevin Gordon in a note. ""I don't think that discomfort leaves us anytime soon, especially given the fact that monetary and fiscal policy are no longer at investors' backs.""

There is a saying among market analysts that the Fed tends to tighten policy until something breaks, and many analysts believe that this downturn will continue on until the Fed finishes its current round of interest rate hikes. 
""With Federal Reserve policy still poised to accelerate the pace of tightening, with balance-sheet reduction entering the mix and inflation proving somewhat stubborn, investors are shifting their gaze toward potential for a growth scare if not an outright recession,"" wrote Lisa Shalett, chief investment officer at Morgan Stanley Wealth Management, in a note Monday. 
Morgan Stanley predicts a 27% chance of recession in the next 12 months, a probability that jumped from just 5% in March. 
Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, meanwhile, doesn't foresee market cataclysm once the bear market officially begins. ""Volatility has been up a little bit, that has some effect on liquidity in some markets,"" he said during a Wall Street Journal interview Tuesday. ""Nonetheless, the markets are orderly, they are functioning."" 
There have been 17 S&P 500 bear markets (or near bear markets) since World War II with an average drop of nearly 30% and a duration of about a year, according to an analysis by LPL Research. 
The S&P 500 joins the Nasdaq Composite, which has lost more than 30% this year, in bear territory. The Dow, meanwhile, has fallen more than 5,900 points, or nearly 16%, this year.

333,Bath amp Body Works cuts outlook to cover cost of investments driving stock slide,2022-05-20 14:31:00,"Bath & Body Works Inc. shares slumped 8.5% in Friday trading after the personal care and fragrance company cut its outlook to cover the cost of investments in a new loyalty program and technology enhancements.

Bath & Body Works BBWI, -5.35% reported first-quarter profit and sales that beat expectations, but lowered its full-year earnings-per-share forecast to between $3.80 a share and $4.15 a share, below the FactSet consensus for $4.17.

“We are accelerating investments in the business to drive our long-term growth,” said Sarah Nash, interim chief executive of the company, on the earnings call, according to FactSet.

“Long term, we continue to see exceptional opportunities to capitalize on Bath & Body Works’ existing strengths and extend the brand’s global potential.”

The stock slide brought down Victoria’s Secret & Co. VSCO, -4.17% , which fell 6.7% on Friday. Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works were once under the L Brands umbrella before separating in August 2021.

Among the areas Bath & Body Works hopes to grow is its men’s business.

“[M]en’s is a big priority,” Nash said. “This business delivered close to $400 million in net sales in 2021, and we expect it can more than double its size over time.”

And in a time when supply chain bottlenecks persist, Bath & Body Works says it has an advantage with a supply chain that is 85% based in North America.

Wells Fargo says it still has a “bullish” stance on Bath & Body Works.

“The rebased earnings plan is solely a function of costs, a combination of greater inflation, a pull-forward of investments to support being a stand-alone entity with improved tech and CEO transition costs are the culprit,” analysts led by Ike Boruchow wrote.

“We also point out that BBWI has an open CEO seat today, and the idea of a rebased fiscal year plan (with out-year investments moved up into 2022) likely makes the seat even more appealing.”

Wells Fargo rates Bath & Body Works stock overweight with a $70 price target.

“Our view is the stock is still worth owning,” wrote UBS analysts led by Jay Sole.

“While Bath & Body Works probably lacks a catalyst in the short-term […], we expect the price to rise over the next 12 months since Bath & Body Works’ double-digit percent EPS CAGR [compound annual growth rate] is still intact.”

UBS rates Bath & Body Works stock buy with a $102 price target.

“Our take is that top-line momentum remains intact, albeit promotional activities appear elevated year-over-year,” wrote Cowen analysts led by Jonna Kim.

”Further we believe management is doing a good job mitigating the impact by surgically increasing pricing on select products and infusing innovation and newness across categories.”

Cowen rates Bath & Body Works stock outperform with a $60 price target, down from $82.

Bath & Body Works shares have slumped 47.5% for the year-to-date.

334,Prices are rising How much should your salary increase,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"(CNN) When it comes to salary negotiations , job candidates have a lot of leverage these days.

""There are a number of economic factors that are relevant for thinking about salary negotiations right now,"" said Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University. Along with rising inflation, the nationwide labor shortage -- there are now almost two jobs available for every job seeker -- has given workers ""a lot more bargaining power than they have traditionally had in softer labor markets,"" she said.

With that in mind, here's how experts suggest you handle salary negotiations in today's market:

Nice to meet you, how much do you want to make?

Recruiters are getting to the salary question much earlier these days.

""What has really accelerated in the past few months is companies asking candidates very early in the process what their salary expectations are...early on maybe in the first interview or in the screening interview is something that I am seeing happen a lot more than I used to,"" said Kate Dixon, CEO and founder of Dixon Consulting.

But just because they ask, it doesn't mean you have to give a number.

Dixon recommends saying something like: ""Without knowing more about the job and your total rewards, it's hard for me to give you a firm number at this point. What is the hiring range for the role?""

Prices are rising....so how much should your salary?

If you have an offer and the salary falls short of what you were hoping to make, don't be shy about negotiating -- just be sure to do your homework first.

""There is more leverage, there is a shortage of labor, companies need good employees and, with inflation, it is justified to ask for more,"" said Rellie Derfler-Rozin, an associate professor of management and organization at the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland. ""There is room to negotiate. The key part is the preparation.""

Several factors should go into a salary figure, including the typical compensation for someone in your role, industry and location, the unique skills and value you'll bring to the company and economic conditions, like inflation and the labor market.

""It's really important to be well-calibrated. You don't want to go in and ask for too little, but you certainly don't want to ask for too much that it's not credible,"" said Babcock.

Online job sites, including Glassdoor and Payscale, can help you find the pay range for someone in a similar role in the industry, but talking directly to others in the field can also be helpful.

""I encourage people to go beyond what you find on the web,"" said Derfler-Rozin. ""If you know people that have worked there or worked in a similar place, try to have a conversation with them informally and get their advice. People are usually more willing to help and mentor... than we actually anticipate.""

While inflation can be part of your reason for negotiating a higher salary, Derfler-Rozin said it shouldn't be the central argument. Instead, she said to put most of the focus on your unique skills and values.

After showing excitement for the offer, she recommended saying something like: ""I would hope we can discuss something that appropriately reflects the value I am bringing to the company based on my past performance, skills and education. Also, naturally taking into account factors such as the location cost of living and the rising inflation.""

When you don't want to go to the office every day

Negotiating full or partial remote work is likely a lot easier since the pandemic forced many companies to send their workers home to work.

If you're seeking a flexible work schedule, Dixon recommended emphasizing how the arrangement benefits the company.

Dixon suggested saying something like: ""In the last few years, I've found that working remotely really fires up my productivity so I would love to do two days at home and three days at the office. How does that land?""

But if being able to work remotely is a must-have for you, don't wait to bring it up until you have an offer.

""More employers are upfront about it: 'this a fully remote role' or 'this is a hybrid role,'"" Dixon added.

To inquire about the work schedule early on, she suggested saying something like: ""I am glad to talk to you about the role. Given the way that I like to work, I am only considering opportunities that have hybrid or fully remote. Can you tell me how the organization views that?""

Get that ring light

While working from home allows you to skip the commute, it does require certain equipment, which can get expensive.

""It is certainly reasonable to have a good camera, lighting system, chair, printer, whatever the things are that they would be buying for you if you were in the office. It's a reasonable thing to ask for those,"" said Babcock.

You can ask if the company provides a work-from-home stipend. And, if they don't, Babcock suggested coming up with a spreadsheet of projections of items and costs you expect to incur in order to set up your home office.","['Kathryn Vasel', 'Cnn Business']",CNN,https://www.cnn.com/2022/05/20/success/salary-negotiation-job-market-inflation/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220519145331-salary-negotiation-job-market-stock-super-tease.jpeg

May 20 (Reuters) - U.S. bond funds continued to face huge outflows in the week to May 19 on fears that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates higher than previously expected to keep inflation under control.

According to Refinitiv Lipper data, investors offloaded U.S. bond funds worth $8.39 billion in the 19th straight week of net selling.

337,UK retail sales jump unexpectedly but big picture bleak,2022-05-20 11:35:34,"
LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - British retail sales jumped unexpectedly in April as shoppers loaded up on alcohol and tobacco, likely a blip in an otherwise bleak trend that has driven consumer confidence to all-time lows amid a worsening cost-of-living crunch.

Retail sales volumes rose 1.4% month on month after a 1.2% drop in March, the Office for National Statistics said. Economists polled by Reuters had expected a 0.2% monthly fall.

The wider picture remains disconcerting. Retail sales in the three months to April fell 0.3%, after a 0.7% drop in March. Compared with a year ago, sales volumes were 4.9% lower, marking the biggest annual drop since January 2021.


Earlier on Friday, Britain's longest-running gauge of consumer confidence, the GfK survey, fell to its lowest since records began in 1974. read more

UK consumer confidence falls to lowest since records began in 1974

British consumers were hit last month by a double whammy of surging household energy costs and higher taxes, and data published this week showed inflation hit a 40-year high of 9.0%.

The Bank of England thinks inflation will climb above 10% later this year.

""So far, the conflicting signals coming from the data are consistent with our call that the UK will stagnate in Q2,"" said economists from Berenberg Bank.

Sterling was little changed against the dollar after the data.

The ONS said food store sales rose by 2.9% in April, largely driven by strong sales of alcohol, tobacco and 'sweet treats'.

This was ""possibly due to people staying in more to save money,"" ONS statistician Heather Bovill said.

Online clothes sales also did well as people got ready for summer holidays and weddings, she added.

Leading supermarket groups including Tesco (TSCO.L) and Sainsbury's (SBRY.L) have warned of lower profits this year and Premier Foods (PFD.L), the maker of Mr Kipling cakes and OXO stock cubes, said it would raise prices of its products.

""Overall (the data) will still leave the BoE in the same bind, behind the curve on inflation, but fretting over a potentially sharp slowdown, above all in consumer spending,"" said Marc Ostwald, chief economist at brokerage ADM Investor Services.

338,Revenge travel started in 2021 but its really coming back with a vengeance in Summer 2022,2022-05-20 14:17:00,"The term “revenge travel” became a popular way to describe consumers dusting off their itineraries shelved by the pandemic, but 2022 is poised to be an even bigger payback to those dog days of 2020.

That’s because travel and all its incidental spending is back with a vengeance even compared to last year, according to new Mastercard findings — perhaps a surprise for some during a time of decades-high inflation.

There will be 1.5 billion more passengers across the world flying this year compared to 2021 if flight bookings keep ascending at their current trajectory, Mastercard MA, +0.73% said, using data estimates with a global scope. That figure includes the revival of business travel, as more companies put a premium on in-person meetings and weekly face-to-face work schedules.

The projection includes approximately 365 million more people in the U.S., Canada and Mexico who are likely to take to the skies this year compared to last year, Mastercard added.

“‘No one is simply returning to who they were in February 2020.’” — Researchers from market-research firm Destination Analysts

Bookings on short- and medium-haul trips have surpassed pre-pandemic levels by more than one-quarter, while bookings for the longest-range trips are just below 2019 levels after being way behind at the start of 2022.

A shorter trip would be up to approximately 1,200 miles away and a mid-length trip would be up to approximately 2,600 miles respectively.

In April, people paid an average $358 for a U.S. domestic trip, a 41% year-over-year increase, and $865 for an international flight, a 22% rise, according to Hopper, a platform to shop for airline tickets.

While inflation data shows the overall cost of living increased 0.3% from March to April, the month-to-month increase for airfares was a record 18.6%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

When people arrive at their destination, they are ready to spend on good food, drink and the ingredients for good memories: Global tourist spending on “experiences,” such as restaurants and concerts, is 34% higher than 2019 levels.

They’ve been spending more on “things” like souvenirs since summer 2021, Mastercard said. (Credit-card companies obviously have a vested interest in people traveling and feeling confident about spending money this year.)

New destinations

Destination Analysts, a market-research firm for the tourism industry, polled 4,000 U.S. adults from March 15 to 23, 2022, and found a similar wanderlust among prospective travelers.

More than half (55.7%) say they prefer to go to places they have not been to before— up over 8 points over the previous month. “No one is simply returning to who they were in February 2020,” the researchers said.

American travelers are especially thirsty for experiences. As of April, they have shelled out almost 23% more in spending on the category compared to 2019 levels, Mastercard data showed.

“Travelers say they’re making up for lost time post-COVID.”

Two in ten people are planning domestic travel in the coming three months and 12% have international trips coming, according to the Mastercard survey. Just over half (54%) said they are looking forward to “make up” trips following two years of crimped, or no travel.

Some of the international destinations with the sharpest influxes of American tourists include the Dominican Republic, Jamaica and other Caribbean-region countries — places where COVID-19 regulations may be less strict than other destinations, Mastercard said.

The Mastercard findings align with other research forecasting a summer travel season where high costs will not melt many plans.

Around 30% of people say they are getting ready to spend more this summer, and 22% say it’s going to be at least $1,000 more than their typical budget, according to a CreditKarma survey on Thursday.

Putting aside inflation and record-breaking gas prices, one-third said they are paying more because they want to “make up for lost time.” Another reason was getting back to normal life (38%) and 25% cited the “fear of missing out.”

339,Robust Mexican consumer emerges as a bright spot in weak economy,2022-05-20 11:15:09,"
MEXICO CITY, May 20 (Reuters) - Not all is rosy for Mexico's economy as it deals with a two-decade annual inflation high and sluggish economic growth, but consumption levels have now reached pre-pandemic levels in Latin America's second-largest economy.

Spending has increased as Mexicans living abroad sent a record $12.5 billion in remittances home during the first quarter, tourism picked up, pandemic-restrictions and infections eased, while the job market remained strong.

As a result, vendors big and small have been reaping the benefits.


Alicia Doreintes Gerardo, who manages a fruit stand in downtown Mexico City, says sale volumes have improved ""little by little"" over the last three months, despite inflation doubling fruit prices.

Fitch Ratings on Tuesday flagged consumption as one of the Mexican economy's biggest strengths, despite various headwinds.

""Consumption has reached pre-pandemic levels, benefiting from easing mobility restrictions, labor market improvement and relatively strong remittances,"" Fitch said in a note affirming its 'BBB-' rating for Mexico's sovereign debt.

Growing consumption has translated into strong quarterly results at large supermarket chains like Walmart de Mexico (WALMEX.MX) and smaller counterpart La Comer (LACOMERUBC.MX), which posted annual same-store revenue increases in Mexico of 9% and 7.3% respectively last month. read more

Service businesses are also seeing improved demand. Restaurant operator Alsea (ALSEA.MX), which operates local branches of Domino's and Starbucks, saw year-on-year net revenue grow 49% in the first quarter.

Alsea Chief Financial Officer Rafael Grosskelwing noted that the second quarter was off to a strong start, with Easter week revenues soaring by a fifth versus the comparable prepandemic weekend of 2019.

Private consumption in Mexico grew 1.3% in seasonally adjusted terms in February from January, outpacing April's monthly inflation rate of 0.54%, according to the most recent figures published by Mexico's INEGI statistics agency.

Adrian de la Garza, chief economist at Citibanamex, said the consumption data had come as a ""surprise"" and beat expectations.

Citibanamex now forecasts Mexican consumption will grow a total of 2% across 2022, consistent with the monthly growth rate seen so far this year.

Retailers say the consumer boost is being felt nationwide.

""We are having a very, very good performance. Basically all [through] the country, we are seeing a recovery in the trend of our same-store sales,"" Mexican supermarket chain Soriana's chief financial officer recently told analysts.

But not everyone is impressed by Mexico's consumption figures, including Nikhil Sanghani, a Latin America economist at Capital Economics, who said ""it's not faring as badly as expected but it's hardly a barnstorming recovery.""

""Consumption is not falling as it is in Colombia and Chile, but equally [Mexico] never got to their strength in the first place,"" Sanghani added.

Regional headwinds loom too. U.S. rate hikes could squeeze the flow of remittances to Mexico and strict lockdowns in China could worsen supply chain disruptions to Mexico's massive manufacturing base.

Still, unlike China, Mexico has been open for business as the pandemic eases.

""We're at our peak, the cafe is overflowing with people who want to go out,"" said Erik Belmonte, the manager of the WO Barra de Cafe, a coffee shop located in an up-market part of Mexico City.

340,Dow is on pace for longest weekly losing streak since 1923,2022-05-20 00:00:00,"New York (CNN Business)The stock market selloff has left the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for its longest weekly losing streak in nearly a century. 
After opening the day higher, the Dow (INDU) turned negative and was down about 270 points, or 0.9%, in recent trading. The Dow is off by nearly 4% so far this week.
If the Dow finishes down for the week, which it is solidly on pace to do, it would be its eighth-straight weekly loss. That would be the longest weekly losing streak since 1923, according to FactSet data reviewed by LPL Financial.
The long stretch of losses underscores the negative mood on Wall Street as investors grow nervous about high inflation -- and what the Federal Reserve will have to do to get prices under control. 
The broader S&P 500 is on pace for a seventh-straight weekly loss, which would be its longest such slump since March 2001, according to Bespoke Investment Group. The S&P 500 entered bear-market territory Friday, a 20% drop from the all-time high it reached in January.
""From inflation, to a hawkish Fed, to war, to supply chain issues, to China on lockdown, to a slowing economy, there are many reasons stocks have done as poorly as they have recently,"" LPL Financial's Ryan Detrick said in an email. 
Detrick said the silver lining is that history suggest stocks are oversold.

341,The dip is your friend Why some advisers are telling young investors to buy stocks despite stagflation fears roiling markets,2022-05-20 14:17:00,"How low can stocks go? This question has made investors nervous, as they fear one bottom after another.

The answer: Pick a number. Some analysts say brace for further drops, others expect a bounce.

Wall Street is nervous at the prospect of stagflation — the double-edged sword of prolonged inflation and high unemployment — as the Federal Reserve attempts to combat inflation by raising interest rates without pushing the economy into recession.

Anh Tran, managing partner at Orange, Calif.-based SageMint Wealth, has some advice for young investors who have time before they retire: “These are the times that we should take advantage of the market’s volatility and continue to invest.”

She was speaking at CNBC’s “Own Your Money Before it Owns You” event on Thursday.

Why? Generation Z and millennial investors have 25 to 30 years or so recover from another bottom.

“A dip is your best friend, so buy the dip, take advantage of the fact that prices are low right now and don’t try to time the market,” added Paula Pant, host of the podcast “Afford Anything,” also at the event.

“‘These are the times that we should take advantage of the market’s volatility and continue to invest.’” — Anh Tran of SageMint Wealth

Buying the dip or “BTD” is not always as simple or smart a move as it might appear, as Jon Burckett-St. Laurent, a senior portfolio manager at Exencial Wealth Advisors, wrote on MarketWatch in April.

With CPI hovering at 40-year highs — hitting 8.3% in April — he said central banks may not be so eager to intervene with aggressive rate cuts or keep extra money flowing with bond purchases via so-called “quantitative easing,” especially in the event that economic growth slows significantly.

“The next problem with BTD is that a realistic strategy requires more details than ‘buy when the price falls,’” he wrote. “Some questions to consider: What constitutes a dip? What money are we using to buy? When do we sell?”

Instead, Burckett-St. Laurent recommends what he calls a “tactical rebalance” to, for example, 80% stocks and 20% bonds and, once the market has recovered and fundamentals look more secure, move back to 60% stocks and 40% bonds.

He also suggests waiting for blood on the streets. “If stocks are down 50%, it may constitute a sentiment-driven overreaction,” he added. A decline of 3%, 5% or even10%, is not exactly a “generational buying opportunity,” he added.

“‘Some questions to consider: What constitutes a dip? What money are we using to buy? When do we sell?’” — Jon Burckett-St. Laurent, a senior portfolio manager at Exencial Wealth Advisors

Still, a recent survey by personal-finance site Bankrate shows 43% of investors ages 18 to 25 said they’re ready to increase their investments. More than a quarter, 27%, were millennials ages 26 to 41.

But only14% of investors ages 41 to 57, the so-called Gen X demographic. And just 8% of baby boomers, ages 58 to 76, said they were likely to invest more in the market this year. Some 22% said they’d be investing less.

Even those younger investors may be less confident now about buying the dip. The new survey was fielded a month ago — before Wednesday’s stock-market rout in the face of inflation jitters.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.49% , the S&P 500 SPX, -0.60% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, -1.06% all slid into the red again on Friday, after briefly holding onto positive territory earlier in the day.

The Dow and S&P 500 closed Thursday at their lowest since March 2021. The Dow is on track for a 2.3% weekly fall, which would be its eighth straight and the longest since 1932, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

342,Britains Nationwide warns inflation surge could dent house prices,2022-05-20 10:34:25,"
Summary Companies Annual profit nearly doubles to 1.6 billion pounds

Warns of economic hit from inflation

House prices under pressure, but market robust so far - experts

LONDON, May 20 (Reuters) - Nationwide Building Society said on Friday rocketing inflation could send British house prices into reverse, in one of the clearest warnings yet that the deepening cost of living crisis could bring the country's housing boom to an end.

British lenders have benefitted from a buoyant housing market - partly fuelled by pent-up demand and lifestyle changes after pandemic lockdowns - but this may not last, Nationwide warned.

""The emergence of higher inflation, which has been exacerbated by the war in Ukraine, is likely to exert a significant drag on the economy in the near term,"" Nationwide's outgoing chief executive Joe Garner said.


""There is a risk of a downward movement in house prices, given the pressure on household budgets,"" he added.

Banks have become increasingly wary of the impact of higher prices on household budgets, with inflation at levels not seen since the 1980s. read more

House prices have been increasing at double-digit rates annually, but there have been signs of a recent slowdown. read more

""We think there is enough momentum in the market currently to prevent outright falls in 2022, but we expect prices will drop by around 5% in total in 2023-4 and also that transactions will be much weaker,"" said Andrew Burrell, chief property economist at Capital Economics.

Nationwide, which is Britain's second-largest provider of home loans, said housing activity remained higher than pre-pandemic levels this year.

""Whether [inflation pressure] turns into an actual reduction or drop in house prices, remains to be seen over the coming months,"" said Vicki Harris, chief commercial officer at Kensington Mortgages.

STRONG PROFIT

Nationwide's warning came alongside its annual results, which showed its pretax profits nearly doubled to 1.6 billion pounds ($2.00 billion) for the year to April 4.

Its finances were lifted by a strong economic recovery from pandemic lockdowns, including a 6.9 billion pound leap in gross mortgage lending.

It was Garner's last set of results at the helm before former TSB CEO Debbie Crosbie takes over on June 2.

Nationwide competes with the country's big banks but unlike them is owned by its customers.

The lender said member benefit, a gauge of benefits it offers above the market average, remained below its target at 325 million pounds due to low interest rates and strong price competition in mortgages.

Its listed bank rivals Lloyds (LLOY.L) and NatWest (NWG.L) last month reported rising profits but warned of a possible hit to growth from Britain's cost of living crisis. read more

343,Cheer Up Even a Bear Market Has a Silver Lining,2022-05-20 14:16:00,"Rising interest rates, sky-high inflation, lackluster economic growth, pressure on corporate profit margins: It isn’t hard to come up with reasons to be bearish on the stock market right now—or see the S&P 500 down 20% and be full of doom and gloom.

But there are reasons to be optimistic, too. As the S&P 500 officially enters a bear market and wraps up its seventh straight week of losses, now seems like a good time to bring them up.

For starters, a recession isn’t a done deal. Sky-high inflation and the Federal Reserve’s hawkish moves to bring it down, plus the long-running supply chain and Covid-19 drags on growth, are the best known forces that risk tipping the U.S. and global economies into contraction. On the other hand, Americans have significant savings from the past two years that could help cushion the blow of those rising prices, and an ultra-strong job market is another positive for households. And while interest rates are certainly going up, they remain low by historical standards and won’t rise above neutral for some time.

“U.S. economic surprises remain in positive territory,” wrote RBC Capital Markets head of U.S. equity strategy Lori Calvasina. “High frequency economic indicators like dining, flying, back to work, and same store sales remain stable. Freight rates have come down sharply from their highs. Inflation expectations are retreating.”

That hasn’t stopped stocks from largely pricing in a recession since the start of the year. The S&P 500 was down 1.5% on Friday afternoon, stretching its loss to more than 20% from the index’s Jan. 3 record high. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost 15%, and the Nasdaq Composite has tumbled 30%.

“Historically, the S&P 500 has fallen an average of 29% around recession (median of 24%),” wrote Truist co-CIO Keith Lerner on Friday. “With the S&P 500 currently showing a peak-to-trough decline of almost 19%, the market is effectively already pricing in a 60%-75% chance of recession based on the average and median.”

That means typical downside of another 7% to 13% if a recession does in fact arrive, according to Lerner. If it doesn’t, there’s a rally on its way.

“When equity market odds of recession have moved to current levels, 12-month forward returns have been binary,” wrote Keith Parker, head of U.S. equity strategy at UBS, earlier this week. “The S&P 500 fell by -9% on average when a recession materialized but rallied +12% if it did not.”

The entirety of the correction this year has been in the market’s valuation multiple, with analysts not pricing an earnings recession into their models. That could be a miscalculation, and suggest that estimates will have to decline. Or it could mean that the individual-company view is rosier than the macro picture.

“At face value, this year’s decline in the S&P 500 looks a bit unusual,” ​​wrote Thomas Mathews, markets economist at Capital Economics. “Previous large falls, such as in 2007-09 and 2020, have often come alongside big downward revisions to earnings expectations …By contrast, aggregate earnings forecasts for S&P 500 companies have been revised up this year, even as stock prices have tumbled.”

The S&P 500 now trades for less than 17 times its expected earnings over the next four quarters, down from nearly 22 times at the beginning of the year. The multiple is elevated due to the pricey Big Tech stocks at the top of the index, which is weighted by market value. The equal-weight S&P 500, meanwhile, trades for a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just over 14 times.

The optimist’s view is that’s a reasonable valuation that sets the market up for a potential rebound. Measures of investor sentiment, fund flows, and positioning have become significantly more bearish and negative as the market has sold off. Those contrarian indicators historically have been followed by rebounds. The past seven weeks have been painful, but the upshot is a much more attractive starting point for stock investors today.

The entry into a bear market has been the pivot point in the past. The S&P 500 has been higher one month later 83% of the time since 1950, according to Dow Jones Market Data, with an average gain of 3.7%. And a year after entering a bear market, returns have been positive 75% of the time—averaging 17%.

“Equities stand to recover if a recession doesn’t come through, given already substantial multiple de-rating, reduced positioning, and downbeat sentiment,” wrote Marko Kolanovic, J.P. Morgan’s chief global markets strategist.

It’s impossible to call a trough in real time, and a near-term bounce may be followed by further declines. But it isn’t all bad out there. And with stocks pricing in a near worst-case scenario, it wouldn’t take a lot of good news to get the market rising again.

With turbulence and uncertainty writ large on the global stage, investors and financial advisors gathered in Chicago to discuss the outlook for markets and investing and where to find bargains. Here are three key points from the Morningstar Investment conference:

Love it or hate it, Bitcoin is here to stay

Last week, the price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunged, regaining a bit of ground this week. So what is the future of cryptocurrency?

Mark Casey, portfolio manager at Capital Group, said he has a paradoxical view. “Every project I studied in crypto seems like garbage to me, and it doesn’t really have a real reason to exist, other than Bitcoin, which I think could turn out to be one of the most important inventions in all of human history,” he said.

While he is optimistic about Bitcoin, he acknowledged that it is still in its early days. “I think it’s a very early invention. It’s very speculative and it could fail,” Casey said. At the same time, he added, “it’s a profoundly significant invention. I think it could be a big deal in the long term.”

As for where Bitcoin will trade in the future, Christopher Lin, portfolio manager at Fidelity Investments, said no one “has any clue of what the price of Bitcoin or any cryptocurrency is going to do over the next 1- 3- 5- 10 years with any sort of precision or accuracy.”

He said he is neither bullish nor bearish, “because that implies that I know what the price is going to do. I have no idea what the price is going to do. But I think the technology is extremely elegant and could be extraordinarily valuable as an evolution of software computing.”

Opportunities abound for ESG investors

The costs for clean energy solutions were “abysmal as recently as 10 years ago,” said Lucas White, portfolio manager at GMO. The technologies were so uncompetitive that they were only in use thanks to public policy support. Now, transformational changes in areas such as auto manufacturing, utilities, and water have created a heap of opportunities that no longer rely on government aid, he said.

While greenhouse-gas emissions grab most of the headlines when it comes to climate change, water is a looming risk for businesses and investors. Lisa Beauvilain, head of sustainability and ESG at Impax Asset Management, said water “is very important for climate solutions” because it “will be the manifestation of climate in many ways, too much, or too little.”

She looks at investing in water through three lenses: infrastructure, including pipes, valves and pumps; water treatment and recycling; and water utilities.

Ukraine has already beaten Russia

“Ukraine has already won this war,” said former U.S. Ambassador to the Russian Federation Michael McFaul. “Putin has failed in all his major objectives but one.”

Those objectives include reunifying Russia and Ukraine; “denazifying” Ukraine through regime change; demilitarization; seizing the capital Kyiv; and occupying the major cities in the east. Only progress in the eastern Donbas region appears possible at this point.

“Now [Russia] is down to changing the military objectives,” McFaul said. “It’s the defense of Donbas, the independence of Donbas. [Putin] has moved everything there to try to connect Crimea to Donbas.”

Putin has lost “the big war …but that doesn’t mean yet that he’s lost all the battles,” McFaul said, adding that Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky is “the Churchill of our time.”

As for what happens next, he said there were two relatively unlikely outcomes:

“I think it’s a low probability that Putin wins Donbas and pushes up to Kyiv. It isn’t zero,” he said. “One other low probability, but not zero, is that the Ukrainians push the Russians out of their country. I think that is higher than the first one.”

The most probable outcome, McFaul said, is that the fight in Donbas lasts “for several weeks, maybe months, where the borders don’t change that much, and then there are some very hard decisions that especially President Zelensky will have to make. Does he sign a cease-fire and agree to disagree about the borders or do they continue to fight?”

346,Rouble hits 2015 level against euro as EU prepares to pay for gas,2022-05-20 10:26:55,"
Summary

Summary Companies Rouble rallies sharply

Hits strongest since June 2015 vs euro

Sberbank CIB says selling gas for roubles behind rally

Further rouble firming not welcomed by budget

May 20 (Reuters) - The Russian rouble rallied to its strongest levels against the euro and dollar since June 2015 and March 2018 respectively on Friday, which analysts attributed to EU countries preparing to pay Russia for gas and to capital controls imposed by Moscow.

Russia said on Thursday that half of gas giant Gazprom's 54 clients have opened accounts at Gazprombank, as European companies approach imminent deadlines to pay for their gas supplies. read more

Opening such accounts became possible after EU executives allowed member states to keep buying Russian gas without breaching the slew of sanctions they have collectively imposed on Russia over what Moscow calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine that started on Feb. 24.


One of the main reasons for the rouble rally is the switch to roubles from euros that will take place in European payments for Russian gas, said Yuri Popov, a strategist at SberCIB Investment Research, a unit of Russia's No.1 lender Sberbank (SBER.MM).

At 0807 GMT the rouble had firmed more than 5% to 61.10 against the euro in volatile trade on the Moscow Exchange after touching 59.02, its strongest since June 2015.

Against the dollar, it added more than 4% on the day to 59.10 after hitting 57.0750, a level not seen since late March 2018.

The rouble has firmed around 30% to the dollar this year despite a full-scale economic crisis in Russia, making it the best-performing currency, albeit artificially supported by controls imposed in late February to shield Russia's financial sector after it sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine.

The rouble is being partly driven by export-focused companies that are obliged to convert their foreign currency revenue after Western sanctions froze nearly half of Russia's gold and forex reserves.

""Exporters are forced to sell (foreign currency) and there is no one to buy it,"" a trader at an investment company in Moscow said.

Preparations for month-end taxes due next week have also boosted demand for roubles, while demand for dollars and euros remains low due to disrupted imports chains and restrictions on withdrawing foreign currency from bank accounts and moving it out of Russia.

""The key question is whether the central bank will step in as the excessive rouble firming is not in the finance ministry's and budget' plans,"" Evgeny Suvorov, an analyst at CentroCreditBank, said.

Kirill Tremasov, the head of the central bank's monetary policy department, said on Friday that the rouble remained a free-floating currency, RIA news agency reported.

The central bank declined to comment on the rouble rate.

INFLATION BRAKE

Outside the Moscow Exchange, the rouble remained much weaker. Sberbank was selling cash dollars for 68.83 roubles and euros for 71.24 roubles.

A stronger rouble will help put a brake on inflation and is beneficial for importers, but it hurts those who sell goods and services abroad for foreign currency, meaning reduced incomes for Russia's export-dependent budget.

Analysts say Russian authorities are not interested in a substantial rouble strengthening from current levels and expect the currency to weaken by the end of the year.

In a sign that the authorities are ready to gradually lift capital controls, the central bank allowed banks to sell people's foreign currency without any restrictions from May 20, with the exception of U.S. dollars and euros.

Meanwhile, Russian stock indexes were mixed on Friday.

The dollar-denominated RTS index (.IRTS) rose 2.6% to 1,278.9 points. The rouble-based MOEX Russian index (.IMOEX) was 1.4% lower at 2,402.9 points, pressured by the rouble's appreciation.

347,Gold ends Friday unchanged breaks longest streak of weekly declines in four years,2022-05-20 14:15:00,"Gold futures finished steady Friday, as investors turned to Treasurys and the U.S. dollar for safety to end a turbulent week on Wall Street, but gold posted the first weekly gain in a month

Gold for June delivery GC00, +0.04% GCM22, +0.04% edged $0.90 higher, or less than 0.1%, to settle at $1,842.10 an ounce on Comex, after flipping between small gains and losses. It jumped 1.4% Thursday for the best daily percentage rise for the most-active contract since April 12. The yellow metal also booked a 1.7% weekly advance, breaking a string of four consecutive weekly declines, its longest stretch since Aug. 17, 2018, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

July silver SIN22, -1.06% shed 23 cents, or 1.1%, settling at $21.674 an ounce. The most-active contract rose 3.3% for the week, its biggest weekly percentage gain since April 14, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

Treasurys have rallied this week, pulling down yields, as a sharp selloff for equities that has left the S&P 500 index SPX, -0.60% on the brink of a bear market stirred demand for safe-haven assets. The yield on the 10-year note hit a 3 1/2-year intraday high above 3.2% early last week, but has pulled back to around 2.79%.

Retreating bond yields can give gold some breathing room. Rising yields raise the opportunity cost of holding nonyielding assets, but skeptics questioned whether the respite would last.

“Well, the falling yields have been the major trigger of the gold rebound yesterday, therefore the positive momentum could remain short lived, as the medium-term trend for the U.S. yields remains comfortably positive on the back of prospects of higher interest rates in the U.S.,” said Ipek Ozkardeskaya, senior analyst at Swissquote Bank, in a note. “The Federal Reserve (Fed) declared war against inflation, and it will raise the interest rates. The higher rates will have a straight positive impact on the yields.”

While investors fled equities in a brutal week for stocks, a sizable $1.4 billion also was pulled from gold funds in the past week, according to BofA Global Research.

The SPDR Gold ETF GLD, +0.03% shed $1 billion in funds for the week, according to Refinitiv Lipper data.

Gold “carries a liquidity premium and in a ‘sell everything’ environment, some investors often sell what they can to meet redemptions or margin calls,” a weekly World Gold Council report said, while pointing to the sector’s sharp ETF outflows.

“With a growing appetite and need for yield, investors who are moving down the liquidity curve to long-term ‘hard-to-liquidate’ assets are finding that having some gold on hand is even more important.”

The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, +0.35% , a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, was headed for a 1.4% retreat this week after trading at a 20-year high earlier this month. A stronger dollar can also be a headwind for commodities priced in the unit, making them more expensive to users of other currencies.

Gold is at a crossroads on the charts, Ozkardeskaya said, testing resistance at the 200-day moving average near $1,837 an ounce, a level that also “coincides with the negative correction band top, building since mid-April.”

If gold moves convincingly above the 200-day moving average, “we could see the rally persist toward the $1880-$1900 range. And the Russian shock on gold supply could support that move,” she said. “I still maintain my bearish outlook for gold in the medium to long run based on the expectation of higher yields, as the Fed won’t get rid of inflation fast enough. ”

In other metals trade, July copper HGN22, +0.12% fell 0.2% to settle at $4.275 a pound.

348,Airbnb hosts use income from the platform to pay for food rent and mortgages  but three US states are more lucrative than others,2022-05-20 14:14:00,"With prices rising everywhere, Airbnb ABNB, -1.68% hosts report that their hosting money has become essential money.

More than a third of the Airbnb hosts around the world said hosting has helped them to cover the rising costs of living.

The lodging rental company rolled out its annual survey this week that looks into how users interact with the platform. This year, the survey has a focus on global inflation, and asks how it affects hosts and guests to use the platform.

While more than 40% of hosts reporting the income earned through the platform is for extra spending, a similar percentage say they depend on that money to make ends meet. As groceries have become more expensive, nearly half of the hosts across the globe said they use the income to purchase necessities such as food.

According to the Food and Agriculture Organization at the United Nations, the FAO Food Index — an index tracking international price monthly movements — has been up by nearly 30% in April compared to a year ago.

“Nearly 45% of respondents report the money from guests has enabled them to stay in their home in the past year, contributing to their rent or mortgage payments. ”

Nearly 45% of respondents report the money has enabled them to stay in their home, contributing to their rent or mortgage payments.

The company reports that hosts are making more money as people show a greater willingness to travel — a typical host in the U.S. earned a median income from hosting of $13,800 in 2021, up 85% since 2019.

California, Florida and Texas are the top three states — and three of the country’s hottest housing markets — where new hosts in the U.S. earn the most, bringing in $270 million, $265 million and $170 million respectively last year.

The vacation-rental company reported a strong first quarter early this year. With a record-setting year in 2021, the company said its performance shows full recovery from the impact of COVID-19.

On the company’s earnings call, Airbnb Chief Executive Brian Chesky said, “People are also more confident booking travel further in advance, and we’re seeing strong demand for summer bookings and beyond.”

349,Why Is the Stock Market Down Today Dow Slides SP Dips Into Bear Market,2022-05-20 14:11:00,"The stock market’s early rally didn’t last long on Friday, as the S&P 500 entered bear market territory, down more than 20% from its January record high.

In afternoon trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 412 points, or 1.3%, while the S&P 500 was down 1.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 2.1%. All three indexes began the day with gains. If the S&P 500 closes below 3837, it would officially be in a bear market. It touched 3810 this afternoon.

The Dow was on pace to post an eighth straight weekly loss, the worst losing streak since 1932. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq were on track to fall for seven straight weeks, their worst showing since 2001.

Much of the decline in investor confidence this week stems from lackluster retail earnings, which has raised fears that a consumer-led downturn is approaching, Canaccord Genuity analyst Martin Roberge noted, as both revenues and margins could come under pressure at these companies in the coming quarters. “[T]he surge in goods prices and inflation translates into demand destruction as consumers have little choice but to shift their spending patterns toward essentials,” he wrote.

That said, Roberge pointed to some silver linings, including the decline in U.S. bond yields, a leveling off for the U.S. dollar and commodities, and partial reopening in China. “These green shoots should allow markets to enjoy the typical relief rallies seen around the -20% correction mark,” Roberge wrote—but warned that if they don’t, a -30% correction could be next.

Speaking of China, sentiment was boosted earlier Friday after the People’s Bank of China lowered the key five-year prime loan rate for the second time this year. The move to 4.45% to 4.6% was the largest cut on record.

It’s the kind of narrative-changing move the market needed following Wednesday’s rout, which wiped out some $1.5 trillion in market value, but it hasn’t been enough to soothe investors’ jangled nerves.

The Federal Reserve, of course, is raising interest rates and draining money from the economy as it tries to get inflation under control. That’s raised the risk of a recession in the coming months if the Fed tightens too much. Still, there were signs on Thursday that the market was wrestling with how much more it needed to fall to reflect those risks.

“Historically, the S&P 500 has fallen an average of 29% around recession (median of 24%). The market is effectively already pricing in a 60%-75% chance of recession based on the average and median,” wrote Truist Advisory Services Chief Market Strategist Keith Lerner. That said, he noted that given the market’s recent decline and “current oversold backdrop, we would not be sellers at these levels for investors that are aligned with their longer-term allocation targets.”

Still, there could be some small hope to end the week. “The one silver lining from the selling of the past two days was that we managed to close well off from last week’s lows, suggesting a general reluctance to become too bearish too quickly,” said Michael Hewson, an analyst at broker CMC Markets.

Cold comfort, that.

Overseas, the pan-European Stoxx 600 gained 0.7% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index rallied 3%.

Here are some stocks on the move Friday:

Palo Alto Networks (ticker: PANW) shot up 7.7% after the cybersecurity company reported stronger-than-expected results and raised its guidance. It saw sales rise 29% from a year earlier to $1.4 billion in the last quarter and expects revenue to touch as high as $1.55 billion in the current quarter.

Ross Stores (ROST) tumbled 23.9% after its earnings and sales missed analyst forecasts. Its guidance was dreadful as well.

Deere (DE) has fallen 13.8% despite reporting better-than-expected earnings.

Air France-KLM (AF.France) rose 1.1% in Paris trading, after the airline group entered into discussions with private equity giant Apollo Global Management (APO) over a €500 million ($530 million) capital injection. Apollo shares rose less than 0.5% in the U.S. premarket.

Cie. Financière Richemont (CFR.Switzerland) tumbled 13.1% in Zurich trading, after the luxury group behind brands including Cartier and Montblanc reported operating profit short of analysts’ expectations. The company’s chief financial officer suggested supply-chain disruptions weren’t over and that stagflation—slowing growth and inflation—represents the largest headwind.

351,Stockmarket rout pushes SampP 500 into bearmarket territory Dow falls 500 points,2022-05-20 13:45:00,"U.S. stocks were sharply lower Friday afternoon, with the S&P 500 index slipping into bear-market territory and the Dow Jones Industrial Average on track for its longest string of weekly losses in 90 years.

On Thursday, the Dow industrials and S&P 500 booked their lowest closes since March 2021, according to Dow Jones Market Data. For the week, the Dow is heading for a 4.6% drop, while the S&P 500 is on pace to fall 5% and the Nasdaq is poised to tumble 6.2%, FactSet data show, at last check.

What’s driving markets?

A close below 3,837.25 would confirm that the S&P 500 entered a bear market, marking a fall of 20% or more from its Jan. 3 record close.

Wall Street initially took a cue from a strong Asian session, where the Hong Kong Hang Seng HSI, +2.96% ended about 3% higher and the China CSI 300 index 000300, +1.95% rose nearly 2%, but early gains Friday in the U.S. stock market proved fragile.

“Stocks remain on a shaky footing. Investors’ list of worries grows ever larger,” said Fawad Razaqzada, market analyst with City Index and Forex.com, in a note.

”Inflation. Interest-rate hikes. Low economic growth. Stagflation. Recession. Perhaps most importantly for stocks, the Fed is not there to provide cushion, like before,” he wrote.

Stocks were initially buoyed after the People’s Bank of China on Friday cut in its rate on five-year loans, aimed at shoring up weak housing sales by reducing mortgage costs. The country has been battling COVID outbreaks, with lockdowns in industrial hubs such as Shanghai blamed for weak factory and consumer activity data in April.

But analysts said the move also underlined concerns.

“Where the rest of the world is thinking of raising rates because of inflation, they’re cutting rates in order to help the economy,” said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist for online brokerage firm tastytrade Inc., in a phone interview. “I think that’s a little bit of a warning sign,” as U.S. companies that benefit from demand in China may be hurt by a slowing Chinese economy as well as supply-chain disruptions linked to the country’s lockdowns, he said.

The S&P 500 traded into bear-market territory Friday afternoon, with all of its 11 sectors down, FactSet data show, at last check.

Friday is the final day of trading before the expiration of options tied to stocks and exchange-traded funds, which is seen potentially contributing to volatility ahead of the end of the session.

Major U.S. stock indexes remain on track for another week of losses, with investors worried about whether soaring inflation can be brought under control by the Federal Reserve without derailing the economy.

The Dow is heading for its eighth straight weekly decline, which would be its longest since April 1932, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite were on track for a seventh straight weekly fall, the longest streak for each since 2001.

Major retailers this week, such as Walmart WMTand Target TGT reported disappointing profits, against a backdrop of rising expenses and inflation.

Mark Hulbert: Here’s the real reason the stock market is coming unglued — and it isn’t because of weak earnings

This past week has shown that the risk of economic downturn, fears that high inflation is cutting into corporate performance and rising borrowing costs remain the major worry for markets, particularly after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said the central bank “won’t hesitate” to lift rates beyond neutral to curb high inflation, according to Christian Stocker, lead equity sector strategist at UniCredit Bank in Munich.

“In this environment, investor sentiment is fickle and markets are likely to remain choppy to both sides until there is greater clarity in terms of recession, rates, and geopolitical risks,” Stocker said.

The U.S. economic data calendar is empty for Friday, but next week will bring another round of inflation data, personal consumption expenditure prices excluding food and energy.

352,The SampP 500 is trading in bearmarket territory How far could it fall,2022-05-20 13:37:00,"The S&P 500 index on Friday traded below the threshold that will mark a bear market if losses hold through the closing bell. History shows that when the bear arrives, it tends to stick around awhile.

The large-cap U.S. benchmark SPX, -0.63% was down 2.3% at 3,813. A close below 3,837.25 would mark a 20% pullback from the S&P 500’s Jan. 3 record finish, meeting the traditional definition of a bear market, according to Dow Jones Market Data.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.52% isn’t terribly far behind, ending at 31,253.13 on Thursday, 15.1% below its Jan. 4 record close. It was down another 1.9% at 30,651 on Friday. A finish below 29,439.72 would put the blue-chip gauge into a bear market.

Need to Know: The technician who called the 2020 market bottom says a ‘shocking rally’ is in store

To be sure, many investors and analysts see that 20% definition as an overly formal if not outdated metric, arguing that stocks have been behaving in bear-like fashion for weeks.

And note, that if the S&P 500 were to close below the threshold in the coming days, the start of the bear market would be backdated to the Jan. 3 peak. A bear market is declared over once the S&P 500 has risen 20% from a low.

OK, so what does history say about what happens once a bear market begins?

There have been 17 bear —- or near-bear—- markets since World War II, said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in a Wednesday note. Generally speaking, the S&P 500 has fallen further once a bear market begins. And, he said, bear markets have, on average, lasted about a year, producing an average peak-to-trough decline of just shy of 30%. (see table below).

The steepest fall, a peak-to-trough decline of nearly 57%, occurred in the 17 months that marked the 17-month bear market that accompanied the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The longest was a 48.2% drop that ran for nearly 21 months in 1973-74. The shortest was the nearly 34% drop that took place over just 23 trading sessions as the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic sparked a global rout that bottomed out on March 23, 2020, and marked the start of the current bull market.

The S&P 500 neared bear territory last week before a strong Friday-the-13th bounce that halved its weekly losses. Another strong bounce was seen May 17, but gains were more than erased in the following session after downbeat results from retailing giant Target Corp. TGT, +1.25% underlined fears that inflation pressures were beginning to take a toll on margins.

The earnings from Target and, a day earlier, Walmart Inc. WMT, +0.04% “have me concerned that bad things may be starting to happen in the U.S. economy,” said Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, in a Thursday note.

”Namely, that the length of high inflation has infiltrated the lower income cohorts of the economy, and they are now reacting, quickly. And as inflation stays high and the economy slows, that will creep ‘up’ the income distribution, and the concern is the margin issues TGT and WMT are facing will spread to other parts of the retail space and the market more broadly,” Essaye wrote.

Mike Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners, worries that Wall Street analysts have yet to catch up to the danger. While earnings expectations for companies in emerging markets and the broader developed-markets indexes have turned down, that isn’t the case for the S&P 500, he noted, in a Thursday interview.. That indicates that the analysts covering the S&P 500 are “behind the curve,” which could be one of the last shoes that has to drop, he said.

353,How Long Do Bear Markets Last SP 500 May Fall Even More More,2022-05-20 13:20:00,"The S&P 500 entered bear-market territory in mid-day trading Friday, falling 20% below its high set in January.

Where the index goes from here is less clear. Of the 12 bear markets since World War II, nine lost at least 25%.

Three of the selloffs were particularly bloody. In 1973, 2000, and 2007, the bear markets began a steep and lasting decline of more than 40%. Five other times, the S&P 500 tumbled very close to bear market territory, just like today, but never quite hit a 20% loss.

For the nine markets that posted more than a 25% drop, the average peak-to-trough decline was 38%. Excluding the more than 40% drops in 1973, 2000 and 2007, the average decline was only 31%. “This could explain why so many investors are targeting a 30% decline,” Martin Roberge, an analyst at Canaccord Genuity, wrote in a note on Wednesday.

There has been a lot of talk about the short-lived “relief rallies” that tend to take place after the market falls by 20%. They often last about two months before things turn ugly again. If a relief rally happens this time, it could last until the start of the second-quarter earnings season, Roberge wrote. This would give investors a chance to unload some of their equity holdings in preparation for worse times.

There are exceptions to this road map. During the 1987 and 2020 flash crashes, the S&P 500 didn’t have relief rallies. If the current selloff is anything like those, wrote Roberge, stocks will lose another 10% to 15% until they reach a bottom in June.

Much scarier were the deep bear markets in 1973, 2000, and 2007, where the S&P 500 plunged an average of 51.4% before touching the bottom. These selloffs were painful and long. From the point when index entered a bear market, it took another 258 days, on average, before it reached the trough.

If the current selloff were to follow this path, a true market bottom won’t be reached until the second quarter of 2023, according to Roberge. “Frankly, we doubt that a 50%+ bear market is in the cards since short- and long-term rates are much lower today,” he wrote. “Still, this is not a 0% probability event.”

Besides the historical records, there are a few other factors that look concerning.

Stocks were historically expensive before the current selloff. Even after the 20% drop, the S&P 500 is still trading around 18 times earnings. For the past bear markets, the index didn’t hit the bottom until it reached 12 times earnings, on average. That means even if company earnings remain stable in the coming months, stocks could still tumble another 30% from here before they find an equilibrium in valuations.

Also unusual: The Federal Reserve continues to promise aggressive rate hikes even though the market is down nearly 20%. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has said that the central bank is determined to get rampant inflation under control regardless of market reactions to rising rates.

In the past bear markets, the Fed has only hiked interest rates once—in March 1974. It didn’t end well. The S&P 500 was down 22% from peak at the time of the rate hike; it didn’t bottom until six months later, when it had lost 48% of its value.

354,Celebrating that your job gets to live in your house rentfree Remote work has fueled US house prices during the pandemic  so what happens when people return to the office,2022-05-20 13:05:00,"Remote work has played a big part in the rise in house prices in the U.S. during the first two years of the pandemic, but just how much?

Many fortunate people have had the freedom to live wherever they choose during the pandemic. John Mondragon, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Johannes Wieland, an associate professor from the Department of Economics at the University of California, San Diego, published a paper this week with a bold conclusion: The shift to remote work explains over half of the 23.8% national house price increase between 2019 and November 2021.

The researchers wrote: “​​Our results imply a fundamentals-based explanation for the recent increases in housing costs over speculation or financial factors, and that the evolution of remote work is likely to have large effects on the future path of house prices and inflation.” The paper was distributed Monday by the National Bureau of Economic Research.

The rise in house prices has pleased those who are able and willing to sell, but caused heartache for millions of first-time buyers who yearn to get a foot on the property ladder.

Home prices soared 15.6% year over year in April, reaching a median price of $424,824, according to Redfin RDFN, -3.17% . On average, the number of homes sold fell to 545,706, a decline of 13.2% from the prior year.

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.3% for the week ending May 12, according to data released by Freddie Mac FMCC, -0.05% . To put that in context: The average rate hovered at 2.94% a year ago.

A recent poll from Gallup found that only 30% of Americans believe now is a good time to buy a house. It’s the lowest level on record since Gallup began surveying Americans on this question beginning in 1978, and it’s the first time less than 50% of people across the country thought it was a good time to buy.

Housing costs — which can take up a third of a family’s take-home pay for a middle-income household — have increased by 5.1% in the past year, the fastest annual pace since 1991, while rents are up 4.8% from a year ago, according to the Labor Department.

Another speed bump for employers, if not for housing markets where people fled during the pandemic: There is a reluctance to return to the office among many employees. As one working-from-home employee wrote on Twitter TWTR, +1.72% : “Both of these things are true: the push for returns to the office is absolutely a capitalist death march/celebrating that your job gets to live in your house rent free without compensation is clown s***.” Another wrote: “We want people to return to the office so those building aren’t abandoned and he’ll be forced to house the unhoused in all them empty buildings!!!!”

A group that calls themselves “Apple Together” signed an open letter to the company, claiming 1,400 signatures from workers. “We are not asking for everyone to be forced to work from home,” they wrote. “We are asking to decide for ourselves, together with our teams and direct manager, what kind of arrangement works best for each one of us, be that in an office, work from home, or a hybrid approach. Stop treating us like school kids who need to be told when to be where and what homework to do.” (Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment.)

The latest NBER research details the relationship between remote work and house prices. “Using variation in remote work exposure across U.S. metropolitan areas we estimate that an additional percentage point of remote work causes a 0.93% increase in house prices after controlling for negative spillovers from migration,” the authors wrote. “This cross-sectional estimate combined with the aggregate shift to remote work implies that remote work raised aggregate U.S. house prices by 15.1%.”

But the rise in house prices could reverse as people return to the office. CoreLogic predicts that home prices will slow to a 5% growth rate in 2023, while Fannie Mae FNMA, +0.48% sees a more tepid 4.2% growth next year.

“Our results also imply that the future path of housing costs may depend critically on the path of remote work,” the NBER paper added. “If remote work reverses, then there may be a general reversal in housing demand and potentially house prices. If remote work persists, we may expect important repercussions as increased housing costs feed into inflation and so affect the response of monetary policy.”

355,Amazon Stock Is a Winner From Targets Wipeout,2022-05-20 11:40:00,"It’s a tough time to be a retailer. The sector has been pummeled this week after lackluster earnings heightened concerns over the health of the consumer amid rising inflation. But this analyst believes online retailing giant Amazon.com can ride out the storm.

First-quarter earnings from big retailers Target (ticker: TGT ) and Walmart ( WMT ) pointed to consumers pulling back in spending across the board, from high-ticket items such as electronics and furniture to daily essentials and groceries.

But for Amazon ( AMZN ), there may yet be a silver lining amid the retail turmoil, according to Citi analyst Ronald Josey, who reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and a $4,100 price target.

“While we recognize the concerns a weaker consumer is likely to have on Amazon’s retail sales and the impact of greater overall costs, we also believe Amazon can gain greater share of retail sales in a more challenged macro environment,” he wrote in a research note.

The analyst believes Amazon can gain greater wallet share thanks to its focus on convenience and faster delivery times compared with its peers. Josey also was optimistic that Amazon can reaccelerate retail growth in the second half of 2022, with July’s Prime Day and back-to-school shopping seasons acting as catalysts ahead of the holiday season.

Moreover, the company is likely to start hiking prices to offset inflationary costs, falling in line with the actions of other retail competitors that already have increased their prices.

It’s worth noting that Amazon hasn’t escaped the retail bloodshed unscathed. The company’s first-quarter earnings in April disappointed investors, with results from its online retailing business and advertising unit coming up short of Wall Street estimates. Amazon also said it had $6 billion in incremental costs for the quarter, and was expecting to have about $4 billion of temporarily higher costs related to inflation during the second quarter.

These costs “are likely to be absorbed” by the fourth quarter, Josey wrote, as the company improves labor productivity and trims down its delivery capacity.

Still, because Amazon’s operations sprawl across the globe, it could well be one of the most affected by inflationary impacts to wages and fulfillment costs to shipping, especially if consumers are spending less.

Following the tech giant’s earnings, BofA Securities analyst Justin Post lowered his price objective to $3,770 from $4,225, saying that it could take a few quarters to optimize costs. The analyst still thinks Amazon remains a top tech bet, however, and is anticipating a margin snap back by 2023.

Amazon shares were up 0.4% to $2,154.51 on Friday. The stock has lost 35% this year.

356,As Global Trade Gets a Reboot Heres How to Profit,2022-05-20 10:14:00,"Globalization reshaped the world economy over the past four decades, linking countries through the free flow of capital, people, and goods to bolster growth and—at least in theory—engender geopolitical harmony. Along the way, it built China into an economic powerhouse, pulled more than a billion people out of poverty, and created a burgeoning middle-class hungry for U.S. goods.

As the world grew closer, U.S. companies tapped low-cost labor abroad to create efficient global supply chains, reducing the need for warehouses filled with inventory and contributing to record profits and a free flow of cheap goods that helped keep a lid on inflation.

Much of that is now in question. U.S.-China tensions, the pandemic, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine have exposed the risks of global integration. China’s ascent into a formidable economic and geopolitical rival has pushed the U.S. to increasingly view its relationship with the world’s most populous country through a national-security lens.

That has been compounded by pandemic-related disruptions. U.S. hospitals are rationing X-rays and CT scans because of shortages in chemicals, in turn caused by factory shutdowns thousands of miles away. Apple (ticker: AAPL) has warned that it could take as much as an $8 billion hit to sales in the current quarter as China’s zero-Covid policy interrupts supply chains and dents economic activity. India and Turkey are banning exports of grains and agricultural products as the war in Ukraine exacerbates food security concerns.

“For years, companies operated on the belief that periodic tensions with China or Russia wouldn’t disrupt critical supply chains covering goods, energy, metals, and minerals,” says Myron Brilliant, head of international affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “That assumption is no longer the case,”

Globalization 2.0 will take shape over years, but the early contours are already visible, with more companies and countries stressing safety and resiliency over cost and efficiency as they look to diversify and duplicate supply chains around the world.

A byproduct, at least in the short term, could be more trade as companies build up inventory as buffers. Even with the trade war, export restrictions that blacklisted some Chinese companies from U.S. technology, and supply-chain disruptions, global trade hit a record $28.5 trillion last year—13% higher than in prepandemic 2019.

In the long run, Globalization 2.0 is likely to be less lucrative for the private sector as governments direct a larger share of investments, often on national-security rather than economic grounds.

“The economic costs are going to be real,” says Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. The result, he says, will be “lost opportunities,” lower returns on investment, and increased volatility.

That volatility could mean opportunity for investors in companies that are facilitating this shift by helping countries become more self-sufficient in critical areas such as semiconductors, or building production closer to home or in friendlier destinations.

Shares of many of these companies could get even cheaper in the coming months as the market digests recession concerns and the broader shifts at play. U.S. equities are baking in earnings growth for the next decade that suggests little change—even as the forces that boosted corporate profits are now challenged, says Rebecca Patterson, chief investment strategist at Bridgewater Associates, who sees reason for caution.

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink warns that the end of globalization as we know it is near—and could bring higher costs and margin pressures. Whirlpool CEO Marc Bitzer recently told analysts that the appliance giant was trying to reposition itself for a “new reality” of geopolitical tensions, freight cost inflation, and increased trade barriers as a result of the decoupling of global economies.

Big changes are ahead in areas linked to national security—including semiconductors and the rare earths critical to tomorrow’s technologies. Congress is expected to pass a China package this summer that includes money for more domestic semiconductor production and incentives to bring manufacturing of critical goods home—or at least move production to friendly countries.

China is moving to shore up its own technology and food security, as well as reduce its reliance on the dollar following the West’s sanctions on Russia. China is banning senior officials of the Communist Party and their families from holding real estate abroad or shares in companies registered abroad, The Wall Street Journal reported this past week.

Barring a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, a decoupling that completely unwinds globalization is unlikely, considering the deep financial and economic ties between the U.S. and China. Exports to China represented about 858,000 U.S. jobs in 2020. More than 300 congressional districts have 1,000 or more jobs supported by those exports, according to the U.S.-China Business Council.

“The winners of this coming wave of globalization will be India and Southeast Asia. Everyone wants to invest there.” — Parag Khanna, founder of global strategic advisory firm FutureMap

The latest survey by the American Chamber of Commerce in China indicated that about half of respondents delayed or decreased investments because of the latest Covid outbreak. Just 14% of businesses surveyed last year by the U.S.-China Business Council reported moving any part of their supply chain out of China. But strategists expect more new investment beyond China as companies look for regional alternatives and countries form regional blocs with like-minded nations.

Parag Khanna, founder of global strategic advisory firm FutureMap, says the U.S. is well positioned for this next wave because it is relatively self-reliant on multiple fronts. At the same time, he sees the center of gravity in trade moving east.

China accounts for 15% of global exports, nearly twice that of the U.S., and is the largest trading partner for just about every major country. China also sits at the center of the world’s largest trade bloc—the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership—which includes Japan and Indonesia, plus a dozen other countries.

Countries are hesitant to pick sides, even as the U.S. begins a campaign to bolster its Indo-Pacific alliance and form closer relationships with India and Southeast Asia.

“The winners of this coming wave of globalization will be India and Southeast Asia. Everyone wants to invest there: There’s a growing middle class and a more open society and democratic ways not found in China,” Khanna says. “They are in the sweet spot of geography, geopolitics, and demography.”

The transition to Globalization 2.0 promises to be gradual and messy, but investors can use the recent global market selloff to identify winners and recalibrate their assumptions about profits, economic growth, and returns.

Three funds and nine companies serve to illustrate the investments in the sweet spot for the upheavals to come.

India’s size, young workforce, and democratic system put it in an attractive spot as companies seek alternatives to China. India is stepping up efforts to become more competitive for manufacturers, cutting taxes and offering incentives to bolster its “Made in India” push, says Matthew Dreith, associate portfolio manager of the Wasatch Emerging Markets Select fund.

The iShares MSCI India exchange-traded fund (INDA) is a broad-based way into the action. Indian industrial companies are another, including air-compressor maker Elgi Equipments (522074.India), which is poised to take market share as companies seek alternative suppliers. It should also see increased demand as companies build duplicative supply chains around the world. Air compressors are widely used in manufacturing plants. Elgi’s valuation—50 times forward earnings—looks pricey, but Dreith says that long-depressed spending is picking up. That should boost margins, and the company’s heavy investments in Europe and U.S. should begin to pay off.

Low labor costs and an established manufacturing base should drive investment into Mexico from U.S. companies looking to bring its suppliers closer to home. While a slowdown in the U.S. could weigh on Mexico, in the longer term, the iShares MSCI Mexico ETF (EWW) offers a way to tap increased investment in the country.

Another beneficiary: Prologis Property Mexico (FIBRAPL14.Mexico), a $2.2 billion real estate investment trust that manages logistics and warehouses, and estimates that 30% of its manufacturing demand came from near-shoring last year. Increased near-shoring, along with growth in e-commerce and supply-chain disruptions, should help the company generate double-digit earnings growth for some time to come, says Matthews Emerging Markets Equity manager John Paul Lech.

Another promising area is emerging as governments look to become more self-reliant. China has laid out a road map of its priorities, with plans to generate 10% of its gross domestic product from the digital economy by 2025, making semiconductors and software critical to its goals. Sung Cho, senior manager for Goldman Sachs Asset Management’s Fundamental Equity, favors local companies like Kingdee International Software Group (268.Hong Kong) and semiconductor makers like Taiwan’s Silergy (6415.Taiwan).

The sharp selloff in Chinese stocks amid concerns about the economy and Beijing’s Covid shutdowns left these stocks trading at a 30% discount to global peers, despite similar growth rates, says Cho.

Semiconductors are the lifeblood of the global economy—a reason that China and the U.S. are intent on bolstering chip manufacturing at home. Demand for chips is also growing. Electric vehicles require double the number of chips that traditional cars do. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) sits atop the chip industry, with a more than 50% market share of global semiconductors and 95% share of 5-nanometer technology crucial to innovations in areas like artificial intelligence, 5G, and other technologies of tomorrow.

The company has been built for resilience, a byproduct of sitting in a geopolitical hot spot and managing relations with customers around the globe. It is building a $12 billion fabrication plant in Arizona and another plant in Japan, and is considering building plants in Singapore and India. At 15 times forward earnings, Taiwan Semi trades below its five-year average, as the sector is hit by concerns of a global slowdown and supply-chain disruptions.

“They are sensitive to U.S.-China tensions and changing world order and are planning around it—and are still in an extremely strong situation, which the market is unable to price properly,” says Jenny Davis, co-manager of Baillie Gifford’s International Alpha Strategy, which oversees $18.3 billion. The company’s dominance and three-year plan for $100 billion in capital spending is on a “monumental scale. No one else can compete.”

Cho favors semiconductor capital-equipment makers, which are selling at about a 25% discount to the S&P 500 index. KLA (KLAC) is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the buildout in leading-edge chip capacity. The company’s stock price has baked in recession fears but not its long-term potential.

The changing nature of global trade could also spark an industrial revolution as companies build new manufacturing hubs or turn to automation to defer the higher costs of shifting to pricier destinations. Industrials are vulnerable to fears of a global recession, but Elias Cohen, head of the international equity team at Neuberger Berman, sees the volatility as a good time to identify companies that are focused on electrical goods, robotics, and machinery, and are well positioned for the next decade.

The iShares Global Industrial ETF (EXI) is a broad-based way to tap the sector. Another beneficiary: Japan’s SMC (6273.Japan), which holds a roughly 45% global market share in pneumatic controls used in manufacturing and has strong pricing power. After selling automation-related stocks last year as valuations got too rich, Cohen has started to add some back in the recent selloff. SMC, for example, trades at 22 times forward earnings, below its five-year average.

Kennametal (KMT) is a U.S. beneficiary of Globalization 2.0 as efforts to build resilience in supply chains, especially around energy and critical minerals, increase demand for the company’s tools, dyes, and bits used in infrastructure projects and oil-and-gas exploration. It sells for 13 times forward earnings.

Charlie Bobrinskoy, who manages the focused value strategy at Ariel Investments, says the price bakes in a recession, even though he puts the recession odds at 50/50. He says the price doesn’t reflect the company’s longer-term prospects from a new phase of globalization.

Freight forwarder DSV (DSV.Denmark) does best when trade patterns change. The Danish company reported a first-quarter net profit that exceeded what it earned in all of 2019. DSV’s capital-light business model churns out cash flow, and management has a strong record of savvy capital allocation and consolidating the industry, says Baillie Gifford’s Davis. Analysts expect the company’s earnings to rise 25%, to $2.2 billion, or $9.70 a share, on top of a 81% increase last year. “The friction of change pushes customers to outsource their organization of freight transport,” says Davis.

The transition to a new type of globalization will come with its share of disruption. That boosts the case for diversification, not just for companies with their supply chains, but also for investors with their portfolios. The latest market upheaval is a good time to start.

357,Australias Woolworths offers to buy majority stake in MyDealcom,2022-05-20 02:05:21,"
May 20 (Reuters) - Australia's Woolworths Group (WOW.AX) on Friday offered to buy 80% stake in online retailer MyDeal.com (MYD.AX), as it looks to take on major internet retail giants operating in the country that includes Amazon.com (AMZN.O).

The A$217.4 million ($152.88 million) deal involves Woolworths paying A$1.05 per share of MyDeal — a near 63% premium to the stock's last close on Thursday. MyDeal's shares surged about 57% and were on track to see their best day ever.

The proposed buyout of MyDeal, one of Australia's largest internet retail businesses, aims to help Woolworths compete better with the likes of Amazon in the country, where it already has rivals in discount department stores Kmart and Target, stationery vendor Officeworks and hardware chain Bunnings — all selling goods that are also sold on Amazon.


""The scheme is an attractive transaction, which provides an all-cash option for MyDeal shareholders"" MyDeal Chairman Paul Greenberg said in statement. Separately, its board also recommended shareholders to vote in favour of the buyout.

Almost 60% of the shares being sold to Woolworths will be from MyDeal's Chief Executive Officer Sean Senvirtne's stake. He will also hold the remaining interest in the company.

Analysts at Barrenjoey said in a note that the acquisition looks to be a tacit acknowledgement that Woolworths's marketplace isn't gaining traction.

""Woolworths has struggled to generate returns in non-food businesses, so we question why they would allocate capital like this.""

The two will discuss a potential partnership on rural connectivity and deforestation monitoring, according to O Globo.

The meeting follows a meeting of the SpaceX and Tesla (TSLA.O) chief executive with Brazilian Communications Minister Fabio Faria in November in Austin, Texas. The two spoke about using SpaceX technology to bring internet to rural schools and cut back on illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.


According to the O Globo report, the Friday meeting will happen in an upscale hotel near the city of Sorocaba in Sao Paulo state and will be attended by several business executives, including Telecom Italia (TLIT.MI) Chief Executive Pietro Labriola and the chairman of Brazilian lender Banco BTG Pactual (BPAC3.SA), Andre Esteves.

Musk will meet Brazil's far-right president just days after he said on Twitter he could no longer support Democrats ""and will vote Republican.""

Bolsonaro, who celebrated Twitter's announcement of its acceptance of Musk's initial bid for the company, has been trying for years to lure Tesla to Brazil.

In 2020, his son, congressman Eduardo Bolsonaro, said he had met with the former charge d'affaires at the U.S. embassy in Brasilia, William Popp, to discuss a plan to attract the automaker to build a factory in the country. Soon after, Bolsonaro stated a desire to visit a Tesla plant on a visit to the U.S.

Summary Companies Target Corp loses quarter of value as profit slumps

Megacap growth stocks drag down S&P 500, Nasdaq

Indexes end: S&P 500 -4.04%, Nasdaq -4.73%, Dow -3.57%

May 18 (Reuters) - Wall Street ended sharply lower on Wednesday, with Target losing around a quarter of its stock market value and highlighting worries about the U.S. economy after the retailer became the latest victim of surging prices.

It was the worst one-day loss for the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average since June 2020.

Target Corp's (TGT.N) first-quarter profit fell by half and the company warned of a bigger margin hit on rising fuel and freight costs. Its shares fell about 25%, losing about $25 billion in market capitalization, in their worst session since the Black Monday crash on Oct. 19, 1987. read more


The retailer's results come a day after rival Walmart Inc (WMT.N) trimmed its profit forecast. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF dropped 8.3%. read more

""We think the developing impact on retail spending as inflation outpaces wages for even longer than people might have expected is a principal factor in causing the market sell-off today,"" said Paul Christopher, head of global market strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute. ""Retailers are starting to reveal the impact of eroding consumer purchasing power.""

Interest-rate sensitive megacap growth stocks added to recent declines and pulled the S&P 500 and Nasdaq lower. Amazon (AMZN.O), Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) dropped close to 7%, while Apple (AAPL.O) fell 5.6%.

""The cons outweigh the pros for growth stocks at this particular moment, and the market is trying to decide how bad it's going to get,"" said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi. ""The market is fearful of the next six months. We may find out that it doesn't need to be as fearful as this, and markets do tend to overreact on the downside.""

All of the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes declined, with consumer discretionary (.SPLRCD) and consumer staples (.SPLRCS) leading the way lower, both down more than 6%.

Rising inflation, the conflict in Ukraine, prolonged supply chain snarls, pandemic-related lockdowns in China and monetary policy tightening by central banks have weighed on financial markets recently, stoking concerns about a global economic slowdown.

Unofficially, the S&P 500 declined 4.04% to end the session at 3,923.68 points.

The Nasdaq declined 4.73% to 11,418.15 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average declined 3.57% to 31,490.07 points.

The S&P 500's busiest trades

The S&P 500 is down about 18% so far in 2022 and the Nasdaq has fallen about 27%, hit by tumbling growth stocks. Almost two-thirds of S&P 500 stocks are down 20% or more from their 52-week highs, according to Refinitiv data.

Wall Street's recent sell-off has left the S&P 500 trading at around 17 times expected earnings, its lowest PE valuation since the 2020 sell-off caused by the coronavirus pandemic, according to Refinitiv data.

S&P 500's forward PE dips below 10-year average

The CBOE volatility index (.VIX), also known as Wall Street's fear gauge, rose to 31 points after falling for six straight sessions.

Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 5.09-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 3.52-to-1 ratio favored decliners.

The S&P 500 posted one new 52-week high and 37 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 25 new highs and 242 new lows.

360,Melvin Capital to shut after heavy losses on meme stocks market slump,2022-05-19 00:06:00,"
May 18 (Reuters) - Melvin Capital, once one of Wall Street's most successful hedge funds which then lost billions in the meme stock saga, will shut down after it was hit again by this year's market slump.

Gabe Plotkin, widely regarded as one of the industry's best traders after posting years of double digit returns, told investors that the last 17 months have been ""an incredibly trying time.""

Plotkin had been trying to turn around the firm after being caught out in early 2021 betting against retail favorite GameStop (GME.N) and after being wrong footed again by tumbling markets this year.


""The appropriate next step is to wind down the Funds by fully liquidating the Funds' assets and accounts and returning cash to all investors,"" Plotkin wrote in a letter reviewed by Reuters on Wednesday.

Melvin Capital had $7.8 billion in assets at the end of April. The fund lost 23% in the first four months of 2022, a person familiar with the fund's finances said.

This year's losses come on the heels of steep losses in 2021 when Melvin Capital ended the year down 39%. The firm bet that shares of GameStop would tumble but was battered when retail investors took the other side and sent the stock surging.

The firm had $12.5 billion in assets at the start of 2021.

In the letter Plotkin said he had already raised a substantial amount of cash and cut the funds' exposure.

A spokesman for Plotkin declined to comment.

For a time powerful investors continued to back Melvin with Citadel LLC and Point72 Asset Management, where Plotkin had once worked, investing billions in emergency cash in early 2021 amid the meme stock losses.

Earlier this year, Plotkin told investors he wanted to reorganize and shrink assets to $5 billion from roughly $8.7 billion and charge them lower fees, for a time. Investors reacted strongly to the proposals and Plotkin was forced to apologize not long after, saying he had made a mistake.

On Wednesday, Plotkin said he had begun the process of liquidating the portfolio and would stop charging management fees beginning June 1. He also said that he had ""given everything"" he could but that it was not enough to ""deliver the returns you should expect.""

At the end of the first quarter Melvin's biggest investments included bets on Live Nation Entertainment (LYV.N), Hilton Worldwide Holdings (HLT.N), Amazon (AMZN.O) and Datadog (DDOG.O). Their stock prices have fallen sharply in the last weeks, sparking speculation that a hedge fund might be trying to unwind positions.

Plotkin was a star investor at Steven A. Cohen's hedge fund which was previously called SAC Capital Advisors but left in 2014 to launch his own firm after SAC pleaded guilty to criminal insider trading charges. Melvin Capital quickly attracted attention and powerful investors and ended 2020, the year the pandemic began, with gains of 52.5%.

From 2014 to 2020, Melvin boasted average annualized returns of 30%. Between the founding and now, the fund returned an average 11.9% per year.

361,Oklahoma abortion ban Starbucks Amazon to cover employee abortion travel costs,2022-05-20 15:06:00,"Starbucks SBUX, +0.86% is one of the latest companies to offer reimbursement to their employees for travel costs when they seek reproductive care in other states, including abortion.

The benefit will be available to any employee who cannot access these services within 100 miles of where they live, and also applies to the dependents of the family.

Several other major companies, including Tesla, Citigroup, Yelp, Lyft, Levi’s, and Amazon, have also announced that they would cover travel expenses for workers with limited access to safe abortion procedures in their home states. Such moves from companies come as abortion rights in the U.S. are under pressure.

Several states, including Texas and Oklahoma, passed restrictive abortion laws in recent years —Oklahoma lawmakers recently approved a bill that would prohibit all abortions with only some exceptions. Tesla moved its corporate headquarters from Silicon Valley to Texas last year.

Additionally, a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court may look to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that legalized abortion in 1973. This has spurred questions about what happens next, including which states (and countries) would still allow abortion, as well as which states would “trigger” a ban on abortion if the ruling is overturned.

See also: What percentage of Americans support Roe v. Wade? How Americans really feel about abortion, according to polls

In fact, “Can you travel to another state for an abortion?” was a breakout Google search in the day following the leaked Roe v. Wade draft opinion, which means the search term spiked by more than 5,000%.

But some Republicans have called out companies for reimbursing workers who travel for reproductive care, like abortion, or for gender-affirming care. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently proposed legislation that would prohibit employers from deducting expenses related to their employees’ abortion travel costs, or gender-affirming care for young children of their employees.

These are some of the companies that have said they will cover travel costs for their employees seeking abortions, and how much some of them will reimburse.

Amazon

On Monday prior to the Supreme Court leak, Amazon AMZN, -0.03% told staff that the company will cover travel expenses for all non-life-threatening medical treatments, including abortions. The e-commerce giant, which is the second-largest private employer in the U.S. behind Walmart WMT, +0.05% , said it will reimburse up to $4,000 per year for such expenses.

The new benefit is effective retroactively to Jan. 1, and applies when the procedure is unavailable within 100 miles of the employee’s home, and virtual care is not possible. It is open to U.S. employees (including warehouse and office workers) or covered dependents enrolled in Premera or Aetna health plans.

Citigroup

Citigroup C, -0.73% also began covering travel expenses earlier this year for U.S. employees forced to go out of state for abortions. About 8,500 of the banking giant’s 65,000 U.S. employees are in Texas, which has banned abortions in the state after about six weeks of pregnancy.

“In response to changes in reproductive health care laws in certain states in the U.S., beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources,” the company said in an April filing.

DoorDash

DoorDash DASH, -2.15% also said it will begin covering travel expenses for abortion procedures after the Supreme Court document was leaked.

“It’s paramount that all DoorDash employees and their dependents covered on our health plans have access to safe, timely healthcare. This is one of our guiding principles as an employer,” a DoorDash spokesperson told MarketWatch. “Because safe abortion procedures may become severely limited in more states, DoorDash will cover certain travel-related expenses for employees who face new barriers to access and need to travel out of state for abortion-related care.”

Levi Strauss

Clothing-maker Levi Strauss LEVI, -0.92% announced Wednesday that the company will also cover travel costs for medical procedures that cannot be performed in the state their employees are in, which includes abortion.

The company says employees are “eligible for reimbursement for healthcare-related travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including those related to reproductive health care and abortion.”

Levi Strauss also noted that its employees are particularly impacted by the issue of reproductive rights, as 58% of the company’s global workforce is female. “Given what is at stake, business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees,” the company added in its announcement. “That means protecting reproductive rights.”

Microsoft

Microsoft says it will “continue to do everything we can under the law to protect our employees’ rights and support employees” in accessing critical healthcare. Those protections includes services like abortion and gender-affirming care, in the U.S., a Microsoft official told Reuters.

“This support is being extended to include travel expense assistance for these and other medical services where access to care is limited in availability in an employee’s home geographic region,” the statement continued.

Starbucks

Starbucks says employees and their dependents who are seeking reproductive health care can get it on no matter where they live, even if they have to travel for it. The benefit will apply to anyone who cannot access these services within 100 miles of where they live, and this also applies to workers’ dependents.

“Regardless of what the Supreme Court ends up deciding, we will always ensure our partners have access to quality healthcare,” wrote Sara Kelly, acting executive vice president of partner resources, in a letter posted to the Starbucks site. “Whatever healthcare choice you believe is right for you and your family, you deserve access to those services and the benefits that Starbucks provides.”

Tesla

The “People and Culture” portion of Tesla’s newly released 2021 Impact Report notes that the company wants its benefits to exceed the standards of the manufacturing industry. And that includes an expanded Safety Net program and health insurance offering that covers travel and lodging support for Tesla employees “who may need to seek healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state.”

While CEO Elon Musk did not immediately comment, he tweeted in September that he believes “government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics.”

Yelp

Yelp YELP, -0.58% , the crowd-sourced reviews platform, will cover travel expenses for both employees and their dependents who need to go out-of-state for abortions. Yelp has 4,000 employees, including 200 workers in Texas.

Yelp employees can submit the receipts for their travel expenses directly to their health insurance company, so “no one else at Yelp is ever going to know who is accessing this, or how or when, and it will be a reimbursement that comes through the insurance provider directly,” Yelp’s chief diversity officer, Miriam Warren, said in April.

“We’ve long been a strong advocate for equality in the workplace, and believe that gender equality cannot be achieved if women’s healthcare rights are restricted,” Warren also said in a statement at the time.

Other ways companies are supporting abortion access

Ride-sharing service Lyft LYFT, -2.13% announced in April that it will pay any legal fees for its drivers if they are sued for bringing women to clinics to receive abortions, which came as a result of the strict anti-abortion bills in Oklahoma and Texas. The Oklahoma bill, for example, would allow a person to sue another individual who “knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion.”

“This law is incompatible with people’s basic rights to privacy, our community guidelines, the spirit of rideshare, and our values as a company,” Lyft wrote in a blog post.

Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of competitor Uber UBER, -0.04% , tweeted that his company would support its drivers in the same way.

In 2021, Texas-based dating-app company Bumble, which prides itself on being women-founded and women-led, created a relief fund supporting the reproductive rights of women and people across the gender spectrum who seek abortions in the state.

And Match.com’s MTCH, +1.59% CEO Shar Dubey (not the company itself) also created a fund to help Match employees in Texas to seek abortions outside the state at around the same time.

Salesforce CRM, +2.19% CEO Marc Benioff also said in 2021 that the company would cover relocation costs for its Texas employees impacted by the state’s restrictive abortion laws.

“If you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state, Salesforce will help relocate you and members of your immediate family,” a Salesforce company memo stated.

362,Abortion polling What percentage of Americans support Roe v Wade,2022-05-20 14:56:00,"The United States Supreme Court may be looking to strike down Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion ruling from 1973, according to a now-authenticated leaked draft majority opinion published on Politico.

“Roe was egregiously wrong from the start,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the majority opinion draft. “We hold that Roe and Casey must be overruled,” he went on to say, citing a 1992 case that affirmed the 1973 Supreme Court decision.

With the possibility that Roe v. Wade could be overturned, it’s worth taking a look at how Americans feel about the ruling, and about abortion as an issue.

The polling data is pretty clear that a majority of Americans think that Roe v. Wade should not be overturned. According to a January poll from CNN, 69% of Americans want to keep Roe v. Wade intact, while just 30% want the ruling completely overturned.

See also: Starbucks says it will cover abortion travel costs for employees, joining Amazon, Tesla

This position is not a recent change, either, as support has remained fairly consistent for more than 20 years. Since 1989, between 52% and 66% of U.S. adults have said they want Roe v. Wade to remain, according to polling conducted and compiled by Gallup.

And according to data compiled by FiveThirtyEight from Pew, Gallup, the Kaiser Family Foundation and YouGov, roughly 10% to 15% of Americans think abortion should be illegal in all cases, about 25% to 30% want abortion to be legal in all cases, and 55% to 65% tell pollsters that they want abortion to be legal in some or most cases.

When asked if abortion should be legal in the first trimester, 61% of Americans agree, a slight drop from the 69% of Americans who say they support Roe v. Wade. A majority of Americans also say that abortions in the second and third trimesters should be illegal in almost all cases, according to AP-NORC data.

Only 1.3% of abortions are performed at 21 weeks of gestation or later, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Abortion is a complex issue that is often reduced to two sides, but Americans’ feelings on the matter are more nuanced.

“What it speaks to is the fact that the debate is dominated by the extreme positions on both sides,” Barbara Carvalho, a pollster at Marist, said in 2019. “People do see the issue as very complicated, very complex. Their positions don’t fall along one side or the other.”

Some political analysts have argued that any attempt to overturn Roe v. Wade by the conservative majority on the Supreme Court could result in a boost for Democratic turnout in November’s midterm elections, but voters in recent years have not identified abortion as a top issue. Among registered voters in the 2020 election, abortion ranked 12th highest on a list of issues “very important” to their vote, according to Pew Research, behind other issues such as climate change, gun control and immigration.

See also: We don’t know who the Roe v. Wade leaker is. But the organized, focused and well-funded Republicans may have just won again

The idea of overturning Roe v. Wade has already drawn pushback from Democrats, including President Biden, who responded to the news by calling for voters to “elect pro-choice officials this November,” and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, who indicated he would hold a vote on legislation to codify the right to an abortion into federal law.

Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, criticized the leak of the document more broadly instead of its contents, calling it a “toxic stunt.”

363,Elon Musk visits Brazils Bolsonaro to discuss Amazon rainforest plans,2022-05-20 14:33:00,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — Tesla and SpaceX chief executive officer Elon Musk met with Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro on Friday to discuss connectivity and other projects in the Amazon rainforest.

The meeting, held in a luxurious resort in Sao Paulo state, was organized by Communications Minister Fábio Faria, who has said he is seeking partnerships with the world’s richest man to bring or improve internet in schools and health facilities in rural areas using technology developed by SpaceX and Starlink, and also to preserve the rainforest.

“Super excited to be in Brazil for launch of Starlink for 19,000 unconnected schools in rural areas & environmental monitoring of Amazon,” Musk tweeted Friday morning.

Illegal activities in the vast Amazon rainforest are monitored by several institutions, such as the national space agency, federal police and environmental regulator Ibama.

But deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has surged under Bolsonaro, reaching its highest annual rate in more than a decade, according to official data from the national space agency. Bolsonaro’s critics say he is largely to blame, having emboldened loggers and land grabbers with his fervent support for development of the region.

During the event, Bolsonaro said the region was “really important” to Brazil.

“We count on Elon Musk so that the Amazon is known by everyone in Brazil and in the world, to show the exuberance of this region, how we are preserving it, and how much harm those who spread lies about this region are doing to us,” he said.

Bolsonaro and Musk appeared in a video transmitted live on the president’s Facebook account, standing together on a stage and answering questions from a group of students.

“A lot can be done to improve quality of life through technology,” Musk told the crowd.

Although none of the students asked about Musk’s prospective purchase of Twitter, Bolsonaro said that it represented a “breath of hope.”

“Freedom is the cement for the future,” he said, calling the billionaire a “legend of freedom.”

Musk has offered to buy Twitter for $44 billion, but said this week the deal can’t go forward until the company provides information about how many accounts on the platform are spam or bots.

Like Musk, Bolsonaro has sought to position himself as a champion of free speech and opposed the deplatforming of individuals including his ally, former U.S. President Donald Trump.

The meeting with Bolsonaro occurs just five months before the far-right leader will seek a second term in a hotly anticipated election.

365,Experts suggest using WIC government benefits to get baby formula amid a nationwide shortage  but these frustrated parents say thats not a viable option,2022-05-20 13:03:00,"For two months, Kathryn Bauerle, 21, mom of 8-month-old Lori, has been scrambling to find baby formula.

Her town of Cleveland, Ga. immediately felt the squeeze of Abbott’s ABT, -0.01% formula recall in February.

But even before the recall, there was a nationwide baby-formula shortage due to supply-chain issues related to the pandemic. The recall made a tough situation worse.

Relief could be coming, but parents like Bauerle probably won’t feel it for more than a month. Abbott announced Monday that it had signed a consent decree with the Food and Drug Administration that details the steps necessary to resume production at the company’s Sturgis, Mich., plant. Once the FDA confirms that Abbott has taken the initial steps outlined, Abbott expects to have the plant up and running in about two weeks, and formula should hit store shelves in six to eight weeks after that.

“We are such a small town, as soon as the formula got recalled and production stopped, we couldn’t find anything for two months,” said Bauerle.

Around the same time, she received a letter responding to her application to enroll in the government’s Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) with a local office in Cleveland. She was denied.

The WIC program gives participants vouchers or checks every month to help pay for nutritious food, including baby formula, for low-income mothers and children.

Bauerle applied for WIC at the recommendation of her doctor, who suggested WIC could help her access baby formula. Amid the shortage, groups including the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Infant Nutrition Council of America and government agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services have been recommending WIC as a potential source of formula, but that advice has sometimes proven difficult to follow.

WIC benefits can’t be used to buy formula from online retailers like Amazon AMZN, +0.03% , and in many areas, WIC will only cover certain sizes of canned formula, so parents who can’t find that specific size are out of luck. The program is only open to certain income levels, and, more importantly, it’s been particularly hard hit by supply-chain issues and the Abbott recall. “More than 1.2 million infants receive formula benefits through WIC, and Abbott is the exclusive supplier for more than half of the WIC agencies nationwide,” said Brian Dittmeier, Senior Director of Public Policy at the National WIC Association.

WIC is federally funded, and states and counties operate the program on a local level. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which administers WIC, did not reply to a request for comment.

“‘We are such a small town, as soon as the formula got recalled and production stopped, we couldn’t find anything for two months.’” — Kathryn Bauerle, 21, mother of 8-month-old Lori

Bauerle’s doctor suggested that she should look into WIC for help finding formula last November, so she applied. It took a few months before she heard back that she had been denied, and she did not receive an explanation about why.

After doing some research, she and her husband thought the refusal may have been related to their household income. Bauerle was pregnant with Lori when she applied, so their household may have been counted as a two-person one.

For most states, aside from Alaska and Hawaii, participants in the WIC program cannot earn more than 185% of the federal poverty level. For a two-person household, the 2021-2022 level would be $32,227, and $40,626 for a three-person household.

Bauerle is a stay-at-home mom, and her husband works in pest control, and takes home around $33,000 a year.

“I wish that there wasn’t such a defined cutoff, I mean $30,000 a year only goes so far,” said Bauerle. For families that are “technically” living paycheck to paycheck, there should be more support, she added.

Bauerle said securing formula has turned into both a group effort with friends looking out for each other and a field trip that requires hours of driving.

The worst moments come when the uncertainty and fear of not being able to find anything kicks in, she said: “Laying in bed with my daughter, cuddling her to sleep at night, wondering if we’ll be able to find a formula for her, or worrying if she’s going to be OK.”

And this fear is growing: Bauerle is pregnant with her second child. She’s scared that if the baby-formula shortage continues, her situation will become even more dire.

After Bauerle was rejected from WIC, she talked to others who have succeeded or were already on WIC, but other moms advised her not to count on the program for help accessing baby formula, due to the nationwide shortage.

For now, Bauerle said she will need to pay out of pocket for baby formula.

She said she has heard it could take up to two months to get a WIC application approved, and because of an application backlog due to a surge of applications during the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s taking even longer.

It’s a Catch-22 for parents who are already on WIC: Some have reported that their baby formula benefits don’t help at all, because they couldn’t find the formula in stores.

On several public Facebook FB, +0.64% groups organized for parents looking for baby formula, WIC parents have complained that regardless of WIC, they are paying out-of-pocket for formula for their children, because they’re unable to make use of the benefits.

“I can’t use my WIC card, I’m paying out cash for it and I don’t know what to do anymore, ” said Kathleen Ariel Bonneville, 29, a first-time mom to a 5-month-old based in Willington, Conn. Bonneville wanted to breastfeed her son Jake, but said because she didn’t get the help or instruction she needed from her hospital on breastfeeding, she has used baby formula for her son. (Her hospital in Hartford, Conn. did not reply to a request for comment.)

Bonneville finds it increasingly hard to find formula in her area — she is disabled and takes medicine to help her focus. She doesn’t drive, so she needs help hunting down formula. Recently the hunt has become longer and longer. It took her almost a month to find a few cans on Monday morning in a Walgreens WBA, +0.49% in Stafford, Conn.

“Nobody is helping you. You call the doctor’s office for your son, and they can’t help you. You call WIC, and they can’t help you, and even though it says on the news to call your doctor’s office, they don’t help,” Bonneville said.

She added, “My child is my focus now and will always be.”

WIC programs in different states instruct parents to use a mobile app to find program-approved stores and that sell formula covered by WIC. For example, New York State uses WIC2Go, and Connecticut uses WICShopper.

For Bonneville to use her WIC card to find formula, she needs to check the approved stores on WICShopper. The app usually suggests a Walmart WMT, +0.03% , which has had nothing lately.

Once Bonneville found a 12.4-ounce can, but she couldn’t buy it with a WIC payment, because it wasn’t a size that is covered by WIC.

Currently, there are over 20 baby formula products covered by her WIC benefits, most of which are in larger sizes, she said. Bonneville said the options were recently expanded.

In some areas, WIC benefits only cover Abbott’s Similac formula. Ryan Folks, 34, a hair stylist and mom to an 8-month old girl, is facing that issue. The benefits from her local WIC office in Detroit, Mich. cover Abbott baby formula, all Similac — Similac Advance, Similac Sensitive and others. The program does cover other brands such as Nutramigen or Enfamil, both made by Mead Johnson RBGPF, +2.92% , but they are categorized as “Special Formulas” that require medical documentation.

The Biden administration last Friday urged states to expand the types of formula products covered by WIC amid the shortage. As Abbott has a contract with USDA, the government department on Friday asked the company to extend rebates until the end of August so that states and retailers can plan ahead and buy any products available to help with the on-going shortage. Abbott agreed.

After the Abbot recall, the WIC office Folks uses changed its authorized formula from powder to concentrate. Of the 24 products eligible for purchase with her WIC benefits, 16 were part of the recall, by her count.

Unused WIC benefits cannot be rolled over to the next month, and although her daughter can eat some food now, she must embark on “a field trip” to find formula. When talking to MarketWatch on Monday, she was trying to find money to buy a few cans off another person without WIC assistance.

“I didn’t like that they didn’t have backup plans for us,” Folks said.

366,Why did crypto crash Mark Cuban compares crypto lull to the early internet,2022-05-20 12:51:00,"Mark Cuban, billionaire entrepreneur and owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, thinks that cryptocurrency is on the same downward trend that tech and internet companies hit in the early 2000s.

Bitcoin hit a 10-month low in May, and sales of non-fungible tokens, aka NFTs, plummeted between January and March 2022.

See also: Mark Cuban on board with Biden plan to forgive $10,000 in student loans: ‘It has to be fixed’

Cuban addressed the slump in a viral Twitter TWTR, +1.80% thread. “Crypto is going through the lull that the internet went through,” he wrote.

The comparison between cryptocurrency and the early days of the internet has been made by Cuban and others including entrepreneur Gary Vaynerchuk before. The dot-com bubble burst in 2000 after several internet-centric companies received high levels of investment speculation, only to eventually bottom-out.

Cuban sold his company Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for $5.7 billion, just before the dot-com bust. Broadcast.com has since been discontinued.

The billionaire Dallas Mavericks owner is heavily invested and interested in the crypto and NFT space. He claims to own several thousand dollars worth of bitcoin BTCUSD, -3.85% , ethereum ETHUSD, -3.27% and dogecoin DOGEUSD, -3.26% , according to a CNBC report, and also says that 80% of his investments that aren’t on “Shark Tank” are crypto-related.

But what’s next? While NFTs have exploded in popularity over the past few years, with creators like Beeple and NBA Top Shot selling NFTs for millions of dollars, recent NFT sales have plummeted as more creators flooded the marketplace. The average daily transaction volume on OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, was down more than 55% from January 2022 to March 2022, according to crypto data tracking platform Dune Analytics.

“I think that early on, you saw lots of new entrants who were enthusiastic about this, but didn’t necessarily have a grasp of the fundamentals, and I think the cooling is a reflection of that,” Jordan Birnholtz, co-founder at NFT marketplace Neon told Distributed Ledger.

Millionaire Vaynerchuk, who invested early in companies like Facebook FB, +0.61% , Twitter, Uber UBER, -0.10% , Snap SNAP, -0.52% and Venmo, told MarketWatch in July 2021 that he, like Cuban, sees NFTs and crypto following similar paths as the early internet companies in the late 1990s.

“I view NFTs exactly the way I viewed the internet in 1999. Internet stocks and their valuations were through the roof, prematurely, and a lot of things collapsed. Meanwhile, eBay EBAY, -1.12% , Google GOOG, -2.13% and Amazon AMZN, -0.10% were all there,” Vaynerchuk said.

Cuban said somethings similar in a now-deleted tweet last January. “Watching the cryptos trade, it’s EXACTLY like the internet stock bubble. EXACTLY,” he wrote. “I think BTC, ETH, a few others will be analogous to those that were built during the dotcom era, survived the bubble bursting and thrived, like AMZN, EBay, and Priceline. Many won’t.”

Cuban’s latest crypto comments come as prices for many cryptocurrencies are plummeting. Prices for bitcoin and ether were hovering around roughly half their November peaks.

High costs on consumer goods caused by inflation should drive traffic to Ollie’s Bargain Outlet, according to Bank of America.

Analyst Jason Haas gave Ollie’s (ticker: OLLI) a double upgrade to Buy all the way from Underperform on Friday. He wrote in a research note that both higher costs caused by inflation and an increase in closeout merchandise are reasons consumers could be more inclined to shop at the closeout retailer. Haas also upgraded his price objective on the stock to $75 from $39.

368,Amazon Stock Is a Winner From Targets Wipeout,2022-05-20 11:40:00,"It’s a tough time to be a retailer. The sector has been pummeled this week after lackluster earnings heightened concerns over the health of the consumer amid rising inflation. But this analyst believes online retailing giant Amazon.com can ride out the storm.

First-quarter earnings from big retailers Target (ticker: TGT ) and Walmart ( WMT ) pointed to consumers pulling back in spending across the board, from high-ticket items such as electronics and furniture to daily essentials and groceries.

But for Amazon ( AMZN ), there may yet be a silver lining amid the retail turmoil, according to Citi analyst Ronald Josey, who reiterated a Buy rating on the stock and a $4,100 price target.

“While we recognize the concerns a weaker consumer is likely to have on Amazon’s retail sales and the impact of greater overall costs, we also believe Amazon can gain greater share of retail sales in a more challenged macro environment,” he wrote in a research note.

The analyst believes Amazon can gain greater wallet share thanks to its focus on convenience and faster delivery times compared with its peers. Josey also was optimistic that Amazon can reaccelerate retail growth in the second half of 2022, with July’s Prime Day and back-to-school shopping seasons acting as catalysts ahead of the holiday season.

Moreover, the company is likely to start hiking prices to offset inflationary costs, falling in line with the actions of other retail competitors that already have increased their prices.

It’s worth noting that Amazon hasn’t escaped the retail bloodshed unscathed. The company’s first-quarter earnings in April disappointed investors, with results from its online retailing business and advertising unit coming up short of Wall Street estimates. Amazon also said it had $6 billion in incremental costs for the quarter, and was expecting to have about $4 billion of temporarily higher costs related to inflation during the second quarter.

These costs “are likely to be absorbed” by the fourth quarter, Josey wrote, as the company improves labor productivity and trims down its delivery capacity.

Still, because Amazon’s operations sprawl across the globe, it could well be one of the most affected by inflationary impacts to wages and fulfillment costs to shipping, especially if consumers are spending less.

Following the tech giant’s earnings, BofA Securities analyst Justin Post lowered his price objective to $3,770 from $4,225, saying that it could take a few quarters to optimize costs. The analyst still thinks Amazon remains a top tech bet, however, and is anticipating a margin snap back by 2023.

Amazon shares were up 0.4% to $2,154.51 on Friday. The stock has lost 35% this year.

OLLI, -1.92% slipped 0.3% in morning trading Friday, but were outperforming the retail sector by a wide margin, after BofA Securities analyst Jason Haas swung to bullish from bearish on the closeout retailer, citing signs suggesting availability of closeout merchandise has ""meaningfully improved"" over the past several months. Haas double upgraded Ollie's stock to buy from underperform, and nearly doubled his stock price target to $75 from $39, with the new target implying 74% upside from current levels. The improved availability of merchandise comes as retailers over-ordered due to supply-chain concerns and after a sharp drop off in consumer spending on durable goods. Haas also said that as government support programs fade and given increasing inflation, he believes consumers will ""trade-down"" to Ollie's. His research indicates Ollie's prices are 36% below those of Walmart Inc. WMT, -0.01% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.10% .

370,A Profit Recession Is Brewing Expert Says Hunker Down in Cash,2022-05-20 09:46:00,"If there is one person who wasn’t shocked by the massive misses in big retailers’ results this past week, it’s our longtime (but no way old) pal, Stephanie Pomboy, who heads the MacroMavens institutional economic advisory. Even though she has been coping with a (thankfully) mild case of Covid-19, she’s still as sharp, and acerbic, as ever in sizing up the current situation.

Not to lose the short-attention-span types, here are some of Steph’s searing insights:

We’re now experiencing withdrawal pangs after the massive injection of fiscal and monetary stimulus of the past two years, which actually boosted asset values more than real economic activity. With manna no longer falling from Washington, consumers are resorting to credit cards to pay the soaring costs of incidental items, such as food, energy, and rent. Companies also are getting squeezed. Producer prices are racing farther ahead of consumer prices by the biggest margin on record,

There’s also some good news. Amid the shortages of everything out there, the supply of one thing—labor—might improve. Some folks enriched by the soaring prices of assets, whether stocks, houses, or cryptocurrencies, joined the leisure class for a while. As asset prices start to deflate, some of these nouveau riche face the chastening prospect of actually having to return to work.

Pomboy says that both Wall Street and the Federal Reserve have woefully underestimated stimulus policies’ role in the current recovery. After Uncle Sam injected approximately $10 trillion in fiscal and monetary largess into the U.S. economy, nominal gross domestic product increased by about $2.3 trillion, a pathetic bang for the buck. Household net worth ballooned by $34 trillion, however, which compares with the $24 trillion U.S. economy. In effect, U.S. consumers were handed roughly two full years of income, via the increased value of their houses and of their 401(k) accounts and other securities holdings.

Now the movie is on rewind. The notion of consumers sitting on an ample cushion of savings is wrong, Pomboy says, with personal savings back to the December 2019 level. Credit-card balances, which were slashed after America received its government stimulus fix, are ramping up at a record 16% annual clip. It’s hard to imagine consumers taking on double-digit interest charges on plastic if they weren’t strapped to pay the escalating tabs at the checkout counter, gas pump, and rental office, she adds.

The stresses that dominate the everyday lives of most Americans shocked Wall Street via the first-quarter earnings reports from retailers this past week, highlighted by the 28.7% two-day swoon by Target (ticker: TGT) on Wednesday and Thursday. The soaring food, energy, and housing expenses are crowding out discretionary spending, Pomboy says. Retailers who cater to the hoi polloi can’t pass on their rising costs, resulting in massive margin squeezes that are decimating their stocks.

Yet to be seen is the effect of the now-deflating asset bubble. She passed along a chart of the JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) overlaid with the Wilshire 5000 index, which measures the broad U.S. stock market in dollars. Through the most recent reading in March, the tightening in the labor market indicated by JOLTS moved in virtual lockstep with the Wilshire.

Sometime soon, however, the reverse could happen. According to Wilshire Associates, the U.S. stock market has shed some $10.1 trillion in value, or 19.9%, this year through Thursday. The losses are relatively recent, with $7.1 trillion of that drop coming since the current quarter began, including $2.6 trillion in May, $1.7 trillion of which was torched just in Wednesday’s rout.

That doesn’t take into account the approximately trillion dollars in cryptocurrency wealth that’s evaporated globally this year, according to Goldman Sachs’ economic team, led by Jan Hatzius. Declines in household wealth point to a significant drag on spending, not so much from crypto as from conventional assets. Equities accounted for about 33% of household wealth at the end of 2021, compared with just 0.3% for crypto, they write in a client note.

Labor-force participation among younger males—crypto’s main fan base—has nearly fully recovered, the Goldman economists say. Prior academic studies have found that the wealth effect mainly affects labor-force participation among those near retirement age, who might be more apt to take their money and run.

On the surface, the jobs numbers appear to show labor demand continuing to stay ahead of supply. But peering beneath the surface, Pomboy sees confusing data. While April’s establishment survey found a solid 428,000 increase in nonfarm payrolls, the separate survey of households showed a 353,000 decline in employment. While the household series (from which the headline jobless rate is derived) tends to be more volatile month to month, she has never seen such a wide split, suggesting there’s something amiss in the figures.

And recently, some big tech companies, including Meta Platforms (FB), Amazon.com (AMZN), and Uber Technologies (UBER), have announced more restrained hiring policies. Initial claims for unemployment insurance have been creeping up, to 218,000 in the week ended May 14. That’s an historically modest level, but it’s still up from the 53-year low of 166,000, touched in March. As profit margins are squeezed, labor costs are certain to go under the microscope.

At the same time, Pomboy adds, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell wants to come across as “Volcker 2.0,” a reference to the Fed chief who vanquished inflation four decades ago with 20% interest rates and back-to-back recessions. And equity analysts have yet to seriously pare their earnings forecasts, with those for consumer-discretionary companies still pointing to 30% gains for 2022, she observes.

Pomboy’s conclusion: We’re in the early innings of an unfolding profit recession. The Fed would likely welcome wage gains if the jobs market weakens. Meanwhile, she advises investors to resist any temptation to buy the dips. Instead, she advises, hunker down in cash; the lows are still a distance away.

371,Massive paydays for tech CEOs could face investors wrath,2022-05-20 07:18:00,"Shareholders in some of the world’s biggest tech companies will vote next week on top executives’ compensation, as influential advisory services urge them to fight the massive paydays.

“Say on pay” votes are scheduled for Wednesday at Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, -0.19% , Facebook parent company Meta Platforms Inc. FB, +0.58% and Twitter Inc. TWTR, +1.76% , as part of those companies’ annual shareholder meetings. The votes are advisory and nonbinding, but they give investors a chance to make their feelings known about the pay of executives at some of the world’s most famous tech companies, which they have already done this proxy season.

About 66% of Intel Corp. INTC, -1.86% shareholders voted against the chip maker’s executive pay structure last week, including compensation of $178 million for Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission this week. Investors in other tech companies seeking to speak out against hefty executive compensation have backing from shareholder advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services, or ISS, and Glass Lewis, which are both urging Amazon investors to vote against the company’s executive-compensation program, saying executive pay is not aligned with performance.

New Amazon Chief Executive Andy Jassy, who was promoted last year after company founder Jeff Bezos stepped aside as CEO, was awarded an equity grant worth $214 million. Jassy’s stock grant vests over 10 years, starting in 2023, but ISS noted in its proxy paper that the company’s compensation program is entirely time-based, does not have preset performance criteria, and that it is unclear whether Jassy will continue to receive additional equity awards during the next decade.

“Shareholders should be concerned with this year’s disconnect between pay and performance driven by one-off awards in 2021, including a $214 million mega-grant to the new CEO,” Glass Lewis wrote in its proxy research report.

The advisory firms also expressed their concern over equity awards to two other Amazon executives, CEO of Worldwide Consumer David Clark (nearly $57 million) and CEO of Amazon Web Services Adam Selipsky (nearly $82 million).

In its proxy, Amazon said it has explained to investors its philosophy of tying executive pay to long-term performance. The company said “a small minority of investors” disagree with its approach.

ISS is also recommending that investors vote against the executive compensation program of Facebook’s parent company, saying that Meta appears to determine compensation at the discretion of the board committee; that its incentive programs lack disclosed objective metrics and quantified goals; and that other named executive officers “receive very large equity awards that lack performance vesting criteria.”

ISS further states that the security costs for the company’s top two executives, CEO Mark Zuckerberg ($25.3 million in 2020; $26.8 million in 2021) and Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg ($8.5 million in 2020; $11.3 million in 2021), are “exceedingly large” and continue to rise. Zuckerberg had $1 in salary in 2021 and the only other listed compensation for him was security costs, which included a $10 million pretax allowance for personal security that he can use as he sees fit as well as $15.2 million in security costs to the company. Sandberg’s 2021 compensation was $35.3 million, which included a nearly $1 million salary, $850,000 bonus and $22.2 million in stock awards.

In its proxy, Meta said its practices are centered on pay for performance. The company also said the security costs for its top executives are necessary because of their high profiles, and that travel costs for both Zuckerberg and Sandberg were higher in 2021 because of their increased personal travel and a rise in security-personnel costs.

ISS and Glass Lewis also are recommending that investors vote against the executive compensation program at Twitter — although the company does have a pending deal to be taken private by Tesla Inc. TSLA, -8.81% CEO Elon Musk that could render moot any shareholder votes or actions at the meeting.

The advisory firms both expressed concern about a one-time $12.5 million grant awarded to new Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal, who took the helm in November, replacing Jack Dorsey. ISS noted that the equity grant is time-based and not performance-based.

In addition, both firms mentioned that Agrawal was awarded another grant for $12.5 million that appears to be incentive-based, along with a $1 million annual salary. Glass Lewis said in its proxy paper that though it recognized that the disconnect between pay and performance can be affected by a CEO transition, “given the value of the awards granted and their impact on total granted compensation for 2021, we remain concerned by the company’s pay practices.”

Equilar estimated that Agrawal would receive $42 million if he is terminated within a year of a change of control of Twitter.

In its proxy, Twitter touted executive-compensation programs “designed to tie award outcomes to the achievement of financial and performance outcomes, as well as returns to our stockholders.”

Investors are voting against pay packages beyond the tech sector as well. Only 31% of JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s JPM, -1.72% investors voted for that company’s executive-compensation program this week, according to a transcript of its annual meeting. CEO Jamie Dimon’s total compensation for 2021 was $84.4 million, which included a $52.6 million options award that was framed as a “retention bonus.”

The Wall Street Journal reported this week that, according to Equilar, so far this proxy season 23 companies in the S&P 500 have seen less than 70% support for their executive-compensation programs.

Dieter Waizenegger is executive director of SOC Investment Group, which among other things aims to hold corporations accountable for excessive pay for executives. He said SOC advocates a move away from performance-based incentives, “which can be too easily gamed, and instead return to a full-value time-vesting awards model.” He also said compensation-committee members on corporate boards should be held accountable “when it is clear the board is supporting unjustified executive pay packages.”

372,The technician who called the 2020 market bottom says a shocking rally is in store,2022-05-20 07:08:00,"It’s been a terrible week in an awful year for the stock market.

Walmart WMT, -0.04% , Target TGT, +1.19% , and Tencent 700, +3.53% each reported disappointing results to add fuel to the worries about interest-rate hikes and quantitative tightening. But, Melvin Capital aside, there haven’t been signs of capitulation.

Over the last six weeks, equity redemptions have totaled $46 billion, versus $91 billion when the COVID outbreak first became apparent, according to Sean Darby, chief equity strategist at Jefferies. So you could see the argument on why markets may not have plumbed their depths.

Noted technician Tom DeMark, who called the bottom in 2020 after COVID emerged, disagrees. The founder of DeMark Analytics — known for advising hedge fund managers like Paul Tudor Jones and Steven Cohen — told Fundstrat’s head of technical strategy Mark Newton that key markets are on the verge of reversing.

DeMark’s indicators are designed for anticipating turning points, to find overextended price moves, in either direction, that reverse.

The S&P 500 SPX, -0.71% , DeMark says, will see one more sell-off, with a close below 3,863, before a “shocking rally” lifts the index between 4,400 and 4,500. The 10-year TMUBMUSD10Y, 2.784% will make one more high before peaking, and crude oil CL.1, +0.44% will make a top within four trading days — $117.29 per barrel, he forecasts — before turning lower.

The fundamental implications, if he’s correct, would be that the inflationary drivers of energy and commodities are peaking, which would put less pressure on inflation.

373,Roe v Wade Draft How Companies Can Stand Up for Social Issues That Matter,2022-05-20 03:15:00,"About the author: Laurie Hays is the founder of Laurie Hays & Associates, a communications advisory firm.

The culture wars are heating up for U.S. businesses. Many will duck. But those who want to stand their ground should look to Citigroup, the company that messed with Texas and lived to tell the tale.

In March 2018, after a gunman killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., then Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat announced a new firearms policy for the bank. The policy, with some caveats, prohibits retailers that are customers of the bank from offering bump stocks or selling guns to people who haven’t passed a background check or are younger than 21.

As reported by Bloomberg News, the national gun lobby went into overdrive, accused Citi of being “woke” and lobbied for a law passed last year by Texas Republicans that forbid the state from working with any companies that “discriminate” against the firearms industry.

At stake for Citi and other banks that adopted similar policies was $58 billion in debt underwriting fueled by population growth and infrastructure needs. Citi’s ranking as the largest Texas munis manager plummeted while the bank hashed out a recognition from the state attorney general that the policy did not discriminate.

In December, Citi, without making any change to its gun policy, finally resumed business with the state of Texas. It is now leading underwriting for a $1.2 billion bond sale for the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport.

Citi quickly found itself fighting on another front in Texas. Corbat’s successor, CEO Jane Fraser, in response to a Texas law banning abortions after six weeks of pregnancy, announced that Citi would pay travel expenses for employees needing to travel out of state to have access to adequate medical resources. “What we did here was follow our past practices. We respect everyone’s view on this subject,” Fraser said.

Texas state Rep. Briscoe Cain warned Citi that employees who travel outside Texas for an abortion could face criminal charges. He said he would introduce legislation to bar Citigroup from underwriting municipal bonds—again.

Citi has not issued any comments in response. But by standing up to Texas on guns Citi has set a precedent for ignoring the grandstanding and carrying on business as usual. For all the companies that want to demonstrate social purpose and care for employees’ needs, but worry about alienating government stakeholders, breaking through the political noise to stand up for values isn’t too hard.

In 2019, 181 CEOs of America’s biggest companies signed on to a commitment by the Business Roundtable redefining the purpose of the corporation to serve all stakeholders, including workers, as well as shareholders.

The commitment covered rewarding hard work and helping workers adjust to the rapid pace of change in the economy. “We foster diversity and inclusion, dignity and respect,” the statement says.

The statement was a reversal of economist Milton Friedman’s popular view that shareholders are the only ones who count. It invited debate as to whether companies really should think about their stock price less and pay more attention to their employees. Perhaps without realizing it, the statement also placed them squarely in the middle of the so-called culture wars.

Advocates have pointed out that many of the signatories to the statement have fallen short in their pledges to uphold the interests of all stakeholders. Companies have faced pressure to engage on voting rights, Black Lives Matter, abortion, LGTBQ issues, climate, and #MeToo. Covid-19 vaccination requirements also entered the debate.

This has set companies up to enter politics in a way they studiously avoided before, and not just in Texas. Republican governors in Florida and Georgia are now policing business, as the columnist Heather Cox Richardson puts it.

Disney’s confrontation with Gov. Ron DeSantis over education legislation his opponents have labeled the “Don’t Say Gay” law put CEO Bob Chapek to the test. He signed the Roundtable commitment. But he first tried to avoid getting involved, saying he didn’t want the controversy to become a political football.

His workforce revolted and forced him to apologize to them and stand up to Gov. DeSantis.

Now Chapek is fighting Florida to retain tax breaks and governance of the special district created for Disney, the state’s largest employer, since its inception.

The abortion fight has raised the stakes even higher.

The draft under consideration by the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade has turned the social purpose debate upside down. The landmark ruling in 1973 gave women the freedom to decide if they wanted an abortion. If the ruling takes away that right on a federal level, states like Texas, Georgia, Alabama, Arkansas and Florida have strong anti-abortion laws that will kick in. Other states that would also have the power to decide may follow.

For companies that offer healthcare plans that cover abortion and follow federal guidelines of offering equal healthcare to all their employees, this is a practical problem, as much as a moral one. Many operate in states were abortion would become illegal. Companies such as AT&T, which signed the Business Roundtable statement, may not believe it obligates them to take a stance on abortion. The company has stayed with a policy of public silence on the topic.

But nearly 200 CEOs have recognized that the right of women to make their own decision about abortion rights is good for business. It’s an important part of Americans deserving a life of “meaning and dignity,” as the Business Roundtable statement put it. Like Citi, Amazon, Starbucks and Tesla have all announced they would help their Texas employees travel for out-of-state abortion services.

For companies that don’t live up to their social-purpose commitments, there’s a good chance their employees will hold them accountable. Ducking is no longer an option. Citi’s experience shows they can put their money where their mouth is and live another day.

374,Asian stocks rise after China cuts key rate Wall Street edges closer to bear market,2022-05-20 01:44:00,"BEIJING (AP) — Asian stock markets rose Friday after Wall Street fell closer to bear territory, China cut a key interest rate and Japanese inflation edged higher.

Market benchmarks in Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Sydney advanced. Oil prices fell more than $1 per barrel.

Wall Street’s benchmark S&P 500 index lost 0.6% on Thursday as rising interest rates, Russia’s war on Ukraine and a Chinese economic slowdown added to investor unease. The benchmark is down 18.7% from its January high and close to the 20% decline that defines a bear market.

“This is unlikely to be rock bottom, given the tightening of financial conditions ahead,” said Tan Boon Heng of Mizuho Bank in a report. “Reality may again be harsher than expectations.”

The Shanghai Composite Index SHCOMP, +1.60% rose 1.1% to 3,133.77 after the Chinese central bank reduced its rate on a five-year loan in a move that would shore up weak housing sales by cutting mortgage costs. The one-year loan rate that affects commercial borrowers was left unchanged.

That suggests Beijing is “trying to keep easing targeted and that we shouldn’t expect large-scale stimulus,” said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report.

The Nikkei 225 NIK, +1.27% in Tokyo jumped 1.2% to 26,712.36 after the government reported inflation rose to 2.5% in April from the previous month’s 1.3%. It was the first time since 2008 that inflation has risen above the Japanese central bank’s 2% target.

Core inflation, which excludes fresh food and energy, rose to 2.1% from 1.5%, the highest level since 2015, allowing for tax hikes. But the central bank is unlikely to alter its low interest rate policies given the weakness of the economy, which contracted in the last quarter, economists said.

With “GDP yet to surpass its pre-virus level and wage growth still subdued, that won’t convince the Bank (of Japan) that tighter monetary policy is required,” Marcel Thieliant of Capital Economics said in a commentary.

The Hang Seng in Hong Kong HSI, +2.96% gained 2% to 20,532 and the Kospi 180721, +1.81% in Seoul advanced 1.7% to 2,637.99.

Sydney’s S&P-ASX 200 XJO, +1.15% added 1% to 7,138.70. New Zealand and Southeast Asian markets also rose.

On Wall Street, the S&P 500 SPX, -0.72% fell to 3,900.79. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.60% fell 0.8% to 31,253.13. The Nasdaq COMP, -1.19% slipped 0.3% to 11,388.50.

Investors are watching the Federal Reserve for hints of further interest rate hikes to cool inflation that is running at a four-decade high. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said this week the U.S. central bank might take more aggressive action if price pressures fail to ease.

Traders also are uneasy about China’s economy after official data showed factory and consumer activity in April were weaker than forecast after Shanghai and other industrial centers shut down to fight coronavirus outbreaks.

U.S. tech stocks fell Thursday, accounting for a big share of the S&P 500’s drop.

Cisco Systems CSCO, +2.38% slumped 13.7% after the seller of routers and switches cut its profit forecast amid supply chain constraints. Synopsis jumped 10.3% after the software company raised its financial forecasts for the year.

Retailers and other companies that rely on direct consumer spending mostly rose. Amazon AMZN, -0.20% added 0.2% and Expedia EXPE, -2.25% climbed 5.3%.

In energy markets, benchmark U.S. crude CL00, +0.51% lost $1.22 to $108.67 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose $2.62 on Thursday to $112.21. Brent crude BRN00, +0.20% , the price basis for international oil trading, shed 44 cents to $111.55 per barrel in London. It gained $2.93 the previous session to $112.04.

376,Cisco Stock Tumbles What to Know,2022-05-19 15:01:00,"Shares of Cisco Systems are tumbling Thursday because of the company’s disappointing financial results last night. They paint a complex picture of the current state of the tech business.

With Cisco shares down 14% on the day, the stock looks cheap. But there are challenges ahead and unresolved questions that will take time to answer.

The Key Details from Earnings

For the fiscal third quarter ended April 30, Cisco (ticker: CSCO) reported revenue of $12.8 billion, which was flat with a year ago, falling well shy of the company’s own forecast for growth in the 3% to 5% range. Thanks to better-than-expected margins, non-GAAP profits of 87 cents a share actually hit the high end of the company’s target forecast of 85 to 87 cents.

The company said two issues triggered the revenue shortfall. The first was the company’s decision to stop selling products in Russia and Belarus due to the war in Ukraine. That resulted in a $200 million hit to the top-line. Cisco noted that historically, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine combined account for 1% of its revenue. It’s an issue affecting many companies, and that factor alone likely isn’t having much impact on the stock.

The bigger issue involves Covid-19 shutdowns of manufacturing and transportation in China, particularly around Shanghai. On a more granular level, CEO Chuck Robbins said the company was unable to get enough power supply components, reducing its ability to ship finished goods to customers. While manufacturers are producing parts, logistics issues are making it impossible to get them from factories to local ports and onto ships, Robbins said. And he added that the problem is unlikely to be sorted out in the current quarter.

Sure enough, Cisco’s guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter ending in July was a huge miss. Cisco sees revenue for the quarter of between 1% and 5.5%; Wall Street had been projecting a nearly 6% increase. That comes to a top-line shortfall of $1 billion top-line.

No Change in Demand, Cisco Says

Robbins and CFO Scott Herren both insist that, aside from Ukraine situation, the April quarter issues—and those laid out for the July quarter—are 100% related to supply, and reflect no change in demand. That’s heartening, and helps explain why the stock is not down even more.

The tricky issue — and the ammunition for Cisco bears — is the fact that orders have slowed from artificially high pandemic levels.

Over the previous three quarters, Cisco has reported order growth in the 31% to 33% range—but the total fell to 8% in the April quarter. Robbins notes that order growth would have been 10% had the company not stopped doing business in Russia, in line with the year-ago quarter growth rate. Arguably, the big growth numbers from the last three quarters—33% order growth in the January quarter —had easy comparisons with year earlier quarters which were muted by the pandemic. But now Cisco faces three quarters of difficult comparisons.

Complicating the picture is that enterprise orders—business from Cisco’s largest customers—were flat in the quarter, after growing 37% in the January quarter. CFO Herren says those large orders are inherently lumpy, and he advised investors not to read that as any slowdown in demand.

But it is unsettling, and investors aren’t entirely buying the “lumpy” argument. It’s also worth noting that demand from “webscale” customers—large cloud computing players—was up more than 50% in the quarter but also below the level seen in recent quarters. Webscale orders over the last 12 months are up about 100% year over year.

“Peers are not seeing this level of disruption.”

During the Q&A section of the company’s earnings call, a few analysts noted that Cisco’s results seemed more impacted by issues in China than those from other hardware players whose quarters ended in March. Robbins said that the primary supply issues occurred in April, the start of a new quarter for many other hardware companies.

Sure enough, during Apple’s (AAPL) last earnings call in late April, CEO Tim Cook cautioned that his company’s June quarter revenue would be trimmed by $4 billion to $8 billion by Covid-related disruptions and industrywide silicon shortages. Cook specifically called out manufacturing constraints “in the Shanghai corridor.” In other words, there have been hints that the China lockdowns could ding results from other hardware companies—like Cisco.

Cisco’s comments on a shortage of power supplies are weighing heavily on both other networking equipment stocks and other hardware names more generally. Among networking companies, Arista Networks (ANET) shares are off 2% Thursday, Ciena (CIEN) is down 3%, and Juniper Networks (JNPR) is 4% lower. Arista and Juniper already posted their March quarter results, while Ciena is due to report its April quarter earnings on June 2.

Investors are now worried about other hardware stocks with off-cycle quarters, as well, including PC makers HP Inc. (HPQ), down 3% Thursday, and Dell Technologies (DELL), off 4%. Enterprise hardware and networking company HP Enterprise ( HPE ) shares are down 6%. They all report results over the next several weeks.

Apple is down 2% on the day, while IBM is off 3%. Both moves likely reflect that investors are getting more worried about overall technology spending, despite Cisco’s insistence that demand remains strong.

The declines came even as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was enjoying a rare day in positive territory.

Robbins has often referred to Cisco’s skill at managing through supply-chain issues, but some analysts wonder if the company’s current component issues are partly of its own making. Needham analyst Alex Henderson, who has a Hold rating on Cisco shares, points out that Arista recently raised guidance, and that Extreme Networks (EXTR) said at a meeting with analysts yesterday that Covid shutdowns were not affecting its outlook.

“Peers are not seeing this level of disruption,” Henderson writes of Cisco’s issues.

Jefferies analyst George Notter thinks Cisco deserves some of the blame. “We’re wondering if Cisco’s isn’t executing crisply with its supply-chain team,” he writes. “Based on our analysis, Cisco was slow to ramp Inventories and purchase commitments while other equipment vendors—such as Arista—reacted several quarters before Cisco. Hence, we’re wondering if supply chain execution is a contributing factor.” That said, he keeps his Buy rating on the stock.

A slew of Wall Street analysts trimmed their price targets for Cisco in the wake of the earnings report, and almost all of them cut their forecasts not only for this quarter, but also for the July 2023 fiscal year.

Wall Street Remains Bullish, Mostly

But multiple analysts see a buying opportunity. Cisco stock now trades for just over 11 times expected profits for fiscal 2023, an undemanding valuation that helps explains the relatively modest reaction to the company’s weak report. Cisco’s decline looks tame compared with Target’s (TGT) drop of 25% on Wednesday after its disappointing earnings report.

Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani concedes that the quarter—and the company’s supply chain execution—are “frustrating,” but he sees the issues as transitory and expects better performance ahead. Strong free cash flow and a modest valuation, he writes, makes Cisco “a name investors should stick with.”

Citi analyst Jim Suva, who points out in his research note that he is the only Wall Street analyst with a Sell rating on Cisco shares, remains cautious. Suva thinks Cisco’s long-term sales guidance for annual growth of 5% to 7% through fiscal 2025 is too high given the supply challenges, which he thinks are triggering market share losses.

Cisco shares are down 14.3% on Thursday, to $41.44. The stock is down 35% this year.

377,The billionaires are bleeding Elon Musk Jeff Bezos and other top earners have lost nearly 200 billion in 2022,2022-05-19 10:18:00,"Get the hankies ready.

The world’s top billionaires lost more than $40 billion as markets cratered on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire’s Index, a daily ranking of the world’s wealthiest.

Still at the top of that list is Tesla’s TSLA, -8.79% chief executive officer, Elon Musk, who lost the most of 500 billionaires. Musk shed $12.3 billion of his personal fortune as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.59% and S&P 500 SPX, -0.72% saw their worst days in two years.

Musk has been pursuing a $44 billion deal for Twitter TWTR, +1.69% , arguing with the social-network service’s CEO Parag Agrawal about spam bots, in what may be a bid to get a cheaper deal or walk away from it all together. Wednesday’s batch of Musk tweets, in which he vowed to vote Republican in the next election and decried the S&P ESG index as a scam after the index dumped Tesla, drew wide attention.

Tesla’s stock-price target was slashed by Wedbush on Thursday, as the analyst citing a “circus show” over Twitter and headwinds from China’s COVID battle. Since the deal was announced on April 25, Tesla has dropped 28%, though that has come amid hefty marketwide losses this year with the S&P 500 flirting with a formal bear market.

Market Extra: How long does the typical bear market last?

Dry those crocodile tears, though, as Musk is still worth $210 billion, even if he’s lost $60.4 billion so far this year.

Just behind Musk is Amazon.com AMZN, -0.14% founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos, whose Wednesday losses came in at close second, with a $8.48 billion drop leaving his fortune at $131 billion. Amazon shares have fallen 35% so far this year, taking a hit from last month’s first reported quarterly loss in seven years. On a year-to-date basis, Bezos has lost $61.6 billion.

No. 3 on the ultrawealth list, Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of French luxury-goods giant LVMH Moët Hennessy LVMH, -2.75% , lost $3.15 billion on Wednesday and has seen his fortune dwindle by $52 billion this year, to $126 billion.

378,Jobs Report Today Unemployment Claims Hit Highest Level Since January,2022-05-19 09:22:00,"The number of Americans filing for first-time jobless claims rose to the highest level since early this year, a possible sign that companies are taking a cautious approach toward spending.

Initial jobless claims rose to 218,000 for the week ended May 14, rising 21,000 from the previous week’s revised level of 197,000. Economists surveyed by data provider FactSet estimated 200,000. This was the highest level since the 222,000 reported for the week ended January 21. The four-week moving average was 199,500, about 8,000 higher than the previous week’s revised average.

The uptick in jobless claims coincides with news of companies cutting back on new hires after seeing substantial growth during the pandemic.

Meta (ticker: FB) announced earlier this month that it’s scaling back plans for adding more employees given the resulting revenue headwinds. Amazon (AMZN) Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky announced in late April that the company has too many workers and it plans to cut back spending in the second quarter.

Uber (UBER) sent an email to staff saying the company would treat “hiring as a privilege and be deliberate about when and where we add headcount.” Online mortgage lender Better.com, meanwhile, has had several rounds of layoffs.

Bill Adams, Chief Economist for Comerica Bank thinks the focus should be on major retailers—manyof whom are reporting margin pressure and softer consumer demand. ” As an example, Target on Thursday scaled back its forecast for margins for the full year. Inflation is also eroding discretionary spending power while the stock market selloff could dampen business sentiment, he noted.

On other hand, even as initial claims have risen, the total rolls of benefit recipients has fallen. The metric called the ‘advance number for seasonally adjusted unemployment insured’ is the lowest on record going back to 1969. It dipped to 1,317,000 in the week of May 7, a decrease of 25,000 from the previous week’s revised level. It’s been hovering under 1,500,000 since April.

Jefferies economist Thomas Simons expects continuing claims to drive even lower. “More people are finding jobs than losing them,” he noted.

It’s the silver lining in what was otherwise a disappointing report.

379,Oklahoma abortion ban Starbucks Amazon to cover employee abortion travel costs,2022-05-20 15:06:00,"Starbucks SBUX, +0.86% is one of the latest companies to offer reimbursement to their employees for travel costs when they seek reproductive care in other states, including abortion.

The benefit will be available to any employee who cannot access these services within 100 miles of where they live, and also applies to the dependents of the family.

Several other major companies, including Tesla, Citigroup, Yelp, Lyft, Levi’s, and Amazon, have also announced that they would cover travel expenses for workers with limited access to safe abortion procedures in their home states. Such moves from companies come as abortion rights in the U.S. are under pressure.

Several states, including Texas and Oklahoma, passed restrictive abortion laws in recent years —Oklahoma lawmakers recently approved a bill that would prohibit all abortions with only some exceptions. Tesla moved its corporate headquarters from Silicon Valley to Texas last year.

Additionally, a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court may look to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark case that legalized abortion in 1973. This has spurred questions about what happens next, including which states (and countries) would still allow abortion, as well as which states would “trigger” a ban on abortion if the ruling is overturned.

In fact, “Can you travel to another state for an abortion?” was a breakout Google search in the day following the leaked Roe v. Wade draft opinion, which means the search term spiked by more than 5,000%.

But some Republicans have called out companies for reimbursing workers who travel for reproductive care, like abortion, or for gender-affirming care. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) recently proposed legislation that would prohibit employers from deducting expenses related to their employees’ abortion travel costs, or gender-affirming care for young children of their employees.

These are some of the companies that have said they will cover travel costs for their employees seeking abortions, and how much some of them will reimburse.

Amazon

On Monday prior to the Supreme Court leak, Amazon AMZN, -0.03% told staff that the company will cover travel expenses for all non-life-threatening medical treatments, including abortions. The e-commerce giant, which is the second-largest private employer in the U.S. behind Walmart WMT, +0.05% , said it will reimburse up to $4,000 per year for such expenses.

The new benefit is effective retroactively to Jan. 1, and applies when the procedure is unavailable within 100 miles of the employee’s home, and virtual care is not possible. It is open to U.S. employees (including warehouse and office workers) or covered dependents enrolled in Premera or Aetna health plans.

Citigroup

Citigroup C, -0.73% also began covering travel expenses earlier this year for U.S. employees forced to go out of state for abortions. About 8,500 of the banking giant’s 65,000 U.S. employees are in Texas, which has banned abortions in the state after about six weeks of pregnancy.

“In response to changes in reproductive health care laws in certain states in the U.S., beginning in 2022 we provide travel benefits to facilitate access to adequate resources,” the company said in an April filing.

DoorDash

DoorDash DASH, -2.15% also said it will begin covering travel expenses for abortion procedures after the Supreme Court document was leaked.

“It’s paramount that all DoorDash employees and their dependents covered on our health plans have access to safe, timely healthcare. This is one of our guiding principles as an employer,” a DoorDash spokesperson told MarketWatch. “Because safe abortion procedures may become severely limited in more states, DoorDash will cover certain travel-related expenses for employees who face new barriers to access and need to travel out of state for abortion-related care.”

Levi Strauss

Clothing-maker Levi Strauss LEVI, -0.92% announced Wednesday that the company will also cover travel costs for medical procedures that cannot be performed in the state their employees are in, which includes abortion.

The company says employees are “eligible for reimbursement for healthcare-related travel expenses for services not available in their home state, including those related to reproductive health care and abortion.”

Levi Strauss also noted that its employees are particularly impacted by the issue of reproductive rights, as 58% of the company’s global workforce is female. “Given what is at stake, business leaders need to make their voices heard and act to protect the health and well-being of our employees,” the company added in its announcement. “That means protecting reproductive rights.”

Microsoft

Microsoft says it will “continue to do everything we can under the law to protect our employees’ rights and support employees” in accessing critical healthcare. Those protections includes services like abortion and gender-affirming care, in the U.S., a Microsoft official told Reuters.

“This support is being extended to include travel expense assistance for these and other medical services where access to care is limited in availability in an employee’s home geographic region,” the statement continued.

Starbucks

Starbucks says employees and their dependents who are seeking reproductive health care can get it on no matter where they live, even if they have to travel for it. The benefit will apply to anyone who cannot access these services within 100 miles of where they live, and this also applies to workers’ dependents.

“Regardless of what the Supreme Court ends up deciding, we will always ensure our partners have access to quality healthcare,” wrote Sara Kelly, acting executive vice president of partner resources, in a letter posted to the Starbucks site. “Whatever healthcare choice you believe is right for you and your family, you deserve access to those services and the benefits that Starbucks provides.”

Tesla

The “People and Culture” portion of Tesla’s newly released 2021 Impact Report notes that the company wants its benefits to exceed the standards of the manufacturing industry. And that includes an expanded Safety Net program and health insurance offering that covers travel and lodging support for Tesla employees “who may need to seek healthcare services that are unavailable in their home state.”

While CEO Elon Musk did not immediately comment, he tweeted in September that he believes “government should rarely impose its will upon the people, and, when doing so, should aspire to maximize their cumulative happiness. That said, I would prefer to stay out of politics.”

Yelp

Yelp YELP, -0.58% , the crowd-sourced reviews platform, will cover travel expenses for both employees and their dependents who need to go out-of-state for abortions. Yelp has 4,000 employees, including 200 workers in Texas.

Yelp employees can submit the receipts for their travel expenses directly to their health insurance company, so “no one else at Yelp is ever going to know who is accessing this, or how or when, and it will be a reimbursement that comes through the insurance provider directly,” Yelp’s chief diversity officer, Miriam Warren, said in April.

“We’ve long been a strong advocate for equality in the workplace, and believe that gender equality cannot be achieved if women’s healthcare rights are restricted,” Warren also said in a statement at the time.

Other ways companies are supporting abortion access

Ride-sharing service Lyft LYFT, -2.13% announced in April that it will pay any legal fees for its drivers if they are sued for bringing women to clinics to receive abortions, which came as a result of the strict anti-abortion bills in Oklahoma and Texas. The Oklahoma bill, for example, would allow a person to sue another individual who “knowingly engages in conduct that aids or abets the performance or inducement of an abortion.”

“This law is incompatible with people’s basic rights to privacy, our community guidelines, the spirit of rideshare, and our values as a company,” Lyft wrote in a blog post.

Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of competitor Uber UBER, -0.04% , tweeted that his company would support its drivers in the same way.

In 2021, Texas-based dating-app company Bumble, which prides itself on being women-founded and women-led, created a relief fund supporting the reproductive rights of women and people across the gender spectrum who seek abortions in the state.

And Match.com’s MTCH, +1.59% CEO Shar Dubey (not the company itself) also created a fund to help Match employees in Texas to seek abortions outside the state at around the same time.

Salesforce CRM, +2.19% CEO Marc Benioff also said in 2021 that the company would cover relocation costs for its Texas employees impacted by the state’s restrictive abortion laws.

“If you have concerns about access to reproductive healthcare in your state, Salesforce will help relocate you and members of your immediate family,” a Salesforce company memo stated.

381,Apple and Microsoft Stocks Rise as Rough Week for Big Tech Ends,2022-05-20 07:33:00,"Megacap technology companies Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Tesla and Meta traded higher on Friday, recovering some of their recent losses.

The companies had seen big selloffs as market sentiment soured over the past few weeks. Faster inflation, a Federal Reserve interest-rate hike and strict Covid lockdowns in China conspired to bring the tech-heavy Nasdaq index of higher-risk stocks into a bear market. The benchmark Nasdaq 100 has lost more than $1 trillion of market value this month.

News that China on Friday unexpectedly lowered a key interest rate that is used as a benchmark for mortgages lifted stocks worldwide. The move raises hopes that the economic slowdown in the world’s second-biggest economy won’t be as bad as feared.

Nasdaq 100 futures rose 1.6% in premarket trading Friday, though the index remains 15% lower than it was a year ago. Apple (ticker: AAPL), the world’s most valuable company until it was overtaken by Saudi Aramco (2222.SA) a few months ago, climbed 1.4%.

Microsoft (MSFT) was up 1.7%, Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) traded up 1.2%, electric-car maker Tesla (TSLA) gained 2.3%, and Meta (FB), the parent company of Facebook, rose 1.4% in the pre-market.

386,Cisco Stock Tumbles What to Know,2022-05-19 15:01:00,"Shares of Cisco Systems are tumbling Thursday because of the company’s disappointing financial results last night. They paint a complex picture of the current state of the tech business.

With Cisco shares down 14% on the day, the stock looks cheap. But there are challenges ahead and unresolved questions that will take time to answer.

The Key Details from Earnings

For the fiscal third quarter ended April 30, Cisco (ticker: CSCO) reported revenue of $12.8 billion, which was flat with a year ago, falling well shy of the company’s own forecast for growth in the 3% to 5% range. Thanks to better-than-expected margins, non-GAAP profits of 87 cents a share actually hit the high end of the company’s target forecast of 85 to 87 cents.

The company said two issues triggered the revenue shortfall. The first was the company’s decision to stop selling products in Russia and Belarus due to the war in Ukraine. That resulted in a $200 million hit to the top-line. Cisco noted that historically, Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine combined account for 1% of its revenue. It’s an issue affecting many companies, and that factor alone likely isn’t having much impact on the stock.

The bigger issue involves Covid-19 shutdowns of manufacturing and transportation in China, particularly around Shanghai. On a more granular level, CEO Chuck Robbins said the company was unable to get enough power supply components, reducing its ability to ship finished goods to customers. While manufacturers are producing parts, logistics issues are making it impossible to get them from factories to local ports and onto ships, Robbins said. And he added that the problem is unlikely to be sorted out in the current quarter.

Sure enough, Cisco’s guidance for its fiscal fourth quarter ending in July was a huge miss. Cisco sees revenue for the quarter of between 1% and 5.5%; Wall Street had been projecting a nearly 6% increase. That comes to a top-line shortfall of $1 billion top-line.

No Change in Demand, Cisco Says

Robbins and CFO Scott Herren both insist that, aside from Ukraine situation, the April quarter issues—and those laid out for the July quarter—are 100% related to supply, and reflect no change in demand. That’s heartening, and helps explain why the stock is not down even more.

The tricky issue — and the ammunition for Cisco bears — is the fact that orders have slowed from artificially high pandemic levels.

Over the previous three quarters, Cisco has reported order growth in the 31% to 33% range—but the total fell to 8% in the April quarter. Robbins notes that order growth would have been 10% had the company not stopped doing business in Russia, in line with the year-ago quarter growth rate. Arguably, the big growth numbers from the last three quarters—33% order growth in the January quarter —had easy comparisons with year earlier quarters which were muted by the pandemic. But now Cisco faces three quarters of difficult comparisons.

Complicating the picture is that enterprise orders—business from Cisco’s largest customers—were flat in the quarter, after growing 37% in the January quarter. CFO Herren says those large orders are inherently lumpy, and he advised investors not to read that as any slowdown in demand.

But it is unsettling, and investors aren’t entirely buying the “lumpy” argument. It’s also worth noting that demand from “webscale” customers—large cloud computing players—was up more than 50% in the quarter but also below the level seen in recent quarters. Webscale orders over the last 12 months are up about 100% year over year.

“Peers are not seeing this level of disruption.”

During the Q&A section of the company’s earnings call, a few analysts noted that Cisco’s results seemed more impacted by issues in China than those from other hardware players whose quarters ended in March. Robbins said that the primary supply issues occurred in April, the start of a new quarter for many other hardware companies.

Sure enough, during Apple’s (AAPL) last earnings call in late April, CEO Tim Cook cautioned that his company’s June quarter revenue would be trimmed by $4 billion to $8 billion by Covid-related disruptions and industrywide silicon shortages. Cook specifically called out manufacturing constraints “in the Shanghai corridor.” In other words, there have been hints that the China lockdowns could ding results from other hardware companies—like Cisco.

Cisco’s comments on a shortage of power supplies are weighing heavily on both other networking equipment stocks and other hardware names more generally. Among networking companies, Arista Networks (ANET) shares are off 2% Thursday, Ciena (CIEN) is down 3%, and Juniper Networks (JNPR) is 4% lower. Arista and Juniper already posted their March quarter results, while Ciena is due to report its April quarter earnings on June 2.

Investors are now worried about other hardware stocks with off-cycle quarters, as well, including PC makers HP Inc. (HPQ), down 3% Thursday, and Dell Technologies (DELL), off 4%. Enterprise hardware and networking company HP Enterprise ( HPE ) shares are down 6%. They all report results over the next several weeks.

Apple is down 2% on the day, while IBM is off 3%. Both moves likely reflect that investors are getting more worried about overall technology spending, despite Cisco’s insistence that demand remains strong.

The declines came even as the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was enjoying a rare day in positive territory.

Robbins has often referred to Cisco’s skill at managing through supply-chain issues, but some analysts wonder if the company’s current component issues are partly of its own making. Needham analyst Alex Henderson, who has a Hold rating on Cisco shares, points out that Arista recently raised guidance, and that Extreme Networks (EXTR) said at a meeting with analysts yesterday that Covid shutdowns were not affecting its outlook.

“Peers are not seeing this level of disruption,” Henderson writes of Cisco’s issues.

Jefferies analyst George Notter thinks Cisco deserves some of the blame. “We’re wondering if Cisco’s isn’t executing crisply with its supply-chain team,” he writes. “Based on our analysis, Cisco was slow to ramp Inventories and purchase commitments while other equipment vendors—such as Arista—reacted several quarters before Cisco. Hence, we’re wondering if supply chain execution is a contributing factor.” That said, he keeps his Buy rating on the stock.

A slew of Wall Street analysts trimmed their price targets for Cisco in the wake of the earnings report, and almost all of them cut their forecasts not only for this quarter, but also for the July 2023 fiscal year.

Wall Street Remains Bullish, Mostly

But multiple analysts see a buying opportunity. Cisco stock now trades for just over 11 times expected profits for fiscal 2023, an undemanding valuation that helps explains the relatively modest reaction to the company’s weak report. Cisco’s decline looks tame compared with Target’s (TGT) drop of 25% on Wednesday after its disappointing earnings report.

Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani concedes that the quarter—and the company’s supply chain execution—are “frustrating,” but he sees the issues as transitory and expects better performance ahead. Strong free cash flow and a modest valuation, he writes, makes Cisco “a name investors should stick with.”

Citi analyst Jim Suva, who points out in his research note that he is the only Wall Street analyst with a Sell rating on Cisco shares, remains cautious. Suva thinks Cisco’s long-term sales guidance for annual growth of 5% to 7% through fiscal 2025 is too high given the supply challenges, which he thinks are triggering market share losses.

Cisco shares are down 14.3% on Thursday, to $41.44. The stock is down 35% this year.

387,The SP 500 Is Almost in a Bear Market This Is the Level to Watch,2022-05-19 14:55:00,"Another day, another sea of red on investors’ screens. The S&P 500 has shed more than $7 trillion in market value since the start of 2022, and is now flirting with a bear market as defined by a 20% fall from recent highs.

The index would enter a bear market if it closes below 3837 points. It was trading around 3900 on Thursday afternoon, down about 0.5%. Another 1% loss would push the S&P 500 below that threshold.

At Thursday’s levels around 31,250, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has a bit more of a cushion. It has lost about 14% this year, and would enter a bear market if it closes below 29,440.

The Nasdaq Composite is already in a bear market—down almost 30% so far in 2022. The same is true of the Russell 2000, which is 27% below its record high set last November.

It has been a volatile decline for the market. According to Instinet’s chief market technician Frank Cappelleri, there have now been 78 daily 1% moves, either up or down, for the S&P 500 over the past 12 months. That’s up from 45 in November.

Volatility is a trademark of bear markets. Since 1970, the number of daily 1% moves has exceeded 120 in a year only three times, always during bear markets. The market isn’t there yet, but it can certainly feel like we’re moving in that direction.

The stock selloff has been most severe in the growth-oriented areas of the market. The Vanguard S&P 500 Value Index exchange-traded fund (ticker: VOOV) has lost about 9% this year, while the Vanguard S&P 500 Growth Index ETF (VOOG) has dropped 26%.

That includes the megacap Big Tech giants, which make up a meaningful portion of market-cap weighted indexes like the S&P 500.

Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (FB), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Tesla (TSLA) are all down more than the market this year. Worst off are Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla, each down more than 40%.

That has dragged on the cap-weighted index’s performance. By comparison, the equal-weighted S&P 500 is down about 14% this year.

388,Stocks Are Way Down Some Fund Managers See Bargains,2022-05-19 13:36:00,"The worry of the month is that the U.S. is headed for a recession, but several fund managers at this week’s Morningstar Investment Conference said they don’t expect a severe slowdown. They are starting to hunt for bargains in the hard-hit tech sector and among industrial companies.

Kate Moore, head of thematic strategy for BlackRock’s Global Allocation Team, said at a panel discussion in Chicago that corporate balance sheets and behavior so far don’t suggest a significant decline in economic activity. T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation manager David Giroux also isn’t too worried about a severe recession, but he says more declines are possible for technology companies that had been selling at lofty valuations without much prospect for profits in the foreseeable future. Those stocks are still expensive, he said.

Giroux is already finding opportunities in other pockets of technology that have also have been beaten up, but have more attractive fundamentals and strong cash flows, including those that can expand revenue three or four times faster than the market but are trading at lows versus the market. Companies he listed include names such as Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA). Amazon.com (AMZN), for example, is trading for the valuation of its cloud business, Amazon Web Service, giving investors its gigantic retail and ad business free, he said.

Even if there is a recession, Giroux said, that risk is already reflected in select semiconductor stocks, industrial conglomerates, and financials given their declines of 30% or more from their highs.

Both semiconductor manufacturers and industrial conglomerates are better positioned than they often are to raise prices, also making them an attractive hedge against inflation, he said. Waste Connections (WCN.Canada) is a name he listed as a winner in terms of pricing power.

BlackRock’s Moore also sees pockets of opportunity in technology, especially software. She favors companies whose valuations are down as much as 40% from the peak but are generating plenty of free cash flow.

Not enough attention is being paid to subsectors of technology like the cloud ecosystem—cloud-computing software companies, but also consulting and others enabling cloud computing—as well as cybersecurity software, she said. Those two categories are areas where chief technology officers “would rather quit their jobs versus their spend” even as they look to cut costs in response to high inflation, she said.

The view from international managers was a little darker. Sammy Simnegar, manager of the Fidelity International Capital Appreciation, sees declining chances of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. The percent of U.S. equities trading above their 20-day moving average—a proxy for breadth, or how broadly supported the market is—is at 29%, he said.

“Narrow markets typically are prescient of an economic slowdown,” he said.

Another pocket of concern is the U.S. housing market, given that median home prices in the U.S. are up from $275,000 in 2019 to $375,000 in 2022, even as mortgage rates have risen from 3% to 5%. Simnegar sees a possible bubble—a reason, he told Barron’s, he sold out of his U.S. housing-related stocks.

More interesting lately are steady growers like Nestlé (NESN.Switzerland), Novo Nordisk (NOVO.B.Denmark) and Sika (SIKA.Switzerland) whose price-earnings ratios have fallen from the mid 30s to a more attractive high 20s, Simnegar said.

Though Moore sees opportunity in high-quality companies trading at some of their cheapest levels, she says highly negative sentiment along with geopolitical and economic uncertainty has kept BlackRock’s $21.6 billion Global Allocation Fund’s cash allocation relatively high at about a quarter.

“Sentiment is bombed out right now,” Moore said. “Generally, you want to lean in, but putting a lot more cash [in now]—we could be stuck in a trading range. I’m not bearish but I’m not in a big rush.”

390,The billionaires are bleeding Elon Musk Jeff Bezos and other top earners have lost nearly 200 billion in 2022,2022-05-19 10:18:00,"Get the hankies ready.

The world’s top billionaires lost more than $40 billion as markets cratered on Wednesday, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire’s Index, a daily ranking of the world’s wealthiest.

Still at the top of that list is Tesla’s TSLA, -8.68% chief executive officer, Elon Musk, who lost the most of 500 billionaires. Musk shed $12.3 billion of his personal fortune as the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.67% and S&P 500 SPX, -0.80% saw their worst days in two years.

Musk has been pursuing a $44 billion deal for Twitter TWTR, +1.65% , arguing with the social-network service’s CEO Parag Agrawal about spam bots, in what may be a bid to get a cheaper deal or walk away from it all together. Wednesday’s batch of Musk tweets, in which he vowed to vote Republican in the next election and decried the S&P ESG index as a scam after the index dumped Tesla, drew wide attention.

Tesla’s stock-price target was slashed by Wedbush on Thursday, as the analyst citing a “circus show” over Twitter and headwinds from China’s COVID battle. Since the deal was announced on April 25, Tesla has dropped 28%, though that has come amid hefty marketwide losses this year with the S&P 500 flirting with a formal bear market.

Market Extra: How long does the typical bear market last?

Dry those crocodile tears, though, as Musk is still worth $210 billion, even if he’s lost $60.4 billion so far this year.

Just behind Musk is Amazon.com AMZN, -0.28% founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos, whose Wednesday losses came in at close second, with a $8.48 billion drop leaving his fortune at $131 billion. Amazon shares have fallen 35% so far this year, taking a hit from last month’s first reported quarterly loss in seven years. On a year-to-date basis, Bezos has lost $61.6 billion.

No. 3 on the ultrawealth list, Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive of French luxury-goods giant LVMH Moët Hennessy LVMH, -2.75% , lost $3.15 billion on Wednesday and has seen his fortune dwindle by $52 billion this year, to $126 billion.

391,Melvin Capitals liquidation may have been the mystery catalyst behind Wednesdays plunge in stocks,2022-05-19 08:17:00,"It wasn’t just Target’s off-target results that blasted U.S. stocks on Wednesday, when the stock market as tracked by the S&P 500 had its worst day in nearly two years.

The liquidation of Melvin Capital also played a major role, says Tom Hayes, chairman and managing member of Great Hill Capital.

The $7.8 billion fund is shutting down, the firm announced late Wednesday. “The thing about a liquidation is that you don’t send the letter until AFTER you’ve done the selling or the vultures will come in and pick you off like a super slow ‘warrior’ at a paintball park,” said Hayes.

Melvin Capital’s 13-F filing shows the top holdings at the end of the first quarter.

“If you were wondering why Amazon, Expedia and Uber UBER, -0.24% were selling off like they were going out of business – when the exact opposite is true (they are leaders in their fields), now you know,” says Hayes.

The so-called Tiger cubs, including Tiger Global, have also been under pressure this year, with Tiger Global losing an estimated $17 billion. Hayes adds the Tiger cubs moved at once in April and early May to sell their technology holdings.

“The acute pain is now likely in the rear view mirror now that the source of the clog has been revealed. We may get a few aftershocks, but the cat is out of the bag at this point,” Hayes adds.

Norway's $1.2 trillion sovereign-wealth fund, the world's largest, said Friday that it has acquired a 50% stake in Sony Center, a mixed-use property in Berlin, for 677 million euros ($713.3 million).

Norges Bank Investment Management, the arm of Norway's central bank that manages the fund, commonly known as the oil fund, said the property comprises 113,000 square meters of office, retail and residential space.

393,Sony Embraces Metaverse to Connect With Gamers Why Meta May Be in for a Battle,2022-05-19 15:48:00,"Sony –one of the world’s largest gaming companies—is embracing the metaverse as a way to create new experiences for game players.

The company “intends to leverage the unique strengths provided by its diverse businesses and expertise in game technology . [by] creating new entertainment experiences in the area of the metaverse,” the Japan-based consumer electronics company said on Wednesday in a release for its annual strategy meeting.

Sony (ticker: SONY ) CEO Kenichiro Yoshida added the metaverse is rising in importance, saying the company’s game division already has proficiency to generate realistic graphics, animations and sound. He also noted that the technologies in their Gran Turismo car game can easily be reused for the metaverse.

Other large technology companies have been investing aggressively in the metaverse—the futuristic vision where consumers can some day play, socialize and work in immersive virtual worlds. Meta Platforms (META), the parent company of Facebook, has lost more than $20 billion over the last three years on projects tied to the metaverse.

But Sony, unlike Meta, has decades of experience in making virtual experiences through software, developing gaming hardware, or designing custom chips. All three capabilities will be critical to win the metaverse future.

Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang agrees Sony has big advantages over traditional technology companies. “We identified Sony as the most unique metaverse stocks due to its vertical reach from hardware-based production tools and solutions to content/IP ownership and generation,” he wrote on Wednesday.

For instance, Sony is developing a new virtual reality headset for its videogame console called PlayStationVR2. While its release day hasn’t been revealed, it should play a key role in creating better metaverse-type experiences compared with competing Meta Quest VR devices.

But the company’s biggest strategic coup may be its close partnership with Unreal game engine maker Epic Games, which is known for enabling the industry’s most advanced gaming titles. Last month, Sony and KIRKBI, the company behind Lego, invested $1 billion each into Epic. At the time Epic CEO Tim Sweeney said the investments will accelerate their work in building the metaverse.
